Jacob Spori at Rexburg, which I considered of such importance as to sub- mit to you for action in the matter. There are a few points, though, that need correcting. Page 1, lines 4-14, he states that I had been consulted by you for the advisability of his going  to Rexburg. I do not know a word about it.  Page 9, lines 9-14. I am not responsible for the foolish talk of that young boy  who expected to be assistant to  Bro. Spori, and to be taught by him. I am afraid the poor  boy is disconcerted about all this trouble.  Although Bro. Spori would have preferred not to have  this letter submitted to you, I put it my duty to do so, as  I cannot say one word in this affair without your in- struction. Please let Bro. Reynolds return Bro. Spori's letter to me to be placed on file, when your decision is  made.  With continued prayers for your welfare I remain Your brother in the Gospel  Karl G. Maeser.

Box, B. Salt Lake City, Utah. Mar. 18, 1891.  Bishop William B. Preston,  City.  Dear Brother:  We are impressed to address you this lettehr, and to solicit your co-oper- ation in the sugar-making enterprise which has been inaugurated lately among us. We  naturally feel reluctant to use our inofluence with our brethren in affairs of this kind, because we are aware of the present stringency of money matters and the many  calls that are made upon our brethren who have means, to invest in one direction and another; but the exigency of this case calls for our active interposition in this bus- iness. We have, in our public capacity, contributed to its stock, and have lent the influence of our credit to aid the company in meeting its contracts. We feel the impor- tance of establishing this industry, for it will furnish employment to a great many  hands, and also provide a market for our agriculturists to dispose of their beets. As you are aware events have been so shaped by those who have obtained power in our  city and county and elsewhere, as to deprive everyone of our faith of all public  employment, and to give the places which they occupied to those who are strangers to  our country. It seems absolutely necessary, therefore, that we sould look to the  interests of our own people, and by wise effort endeavor to establish indnustries which will give them employment.  We believe that this sugar-making business has been examined with  care to furnish more than reasonable ground for hope that it can be made a  success in this country, not only in manufacturing sugar, but in producing good returns for the money invested. The company has a Board of Directors who are practical  business men. They have been selected with a view to  give the public confidence in  ENDENTRY the enterprise. Since the issuance of the enclosed circular, Brother Thomas R. Cutler,  of Lehi, has been chosen Manager of the company. He is known to be an active, ener- getic and safe business man. A change has also been made in the office of Secretary,  James E. Jennings havying been selected for that position.  Those of us who have grown up with this country, and have been so  favored of the Lord since we came here in the accumulation of means, owe it to the  community that we should do our share in helping to develop home industries. In this  case, however, it is not expected that any sacrifice will be involved in purchasing  stock in the sugar company; but it is confidenty anticipated that it will prove a  good investment. We feel that the Lord is in this movement, and that it is our duty,  and the duty of this entire people, to make every exertion possible to carry out this  great branch of manufacture.  Heber J. Grant,  who will be able to answer all questions that you may desire to ask, and to give you  full information concerning this project in all its details; and we trust that you will be able to see your way clear to subscribe for from $2500. to $5000. worth of stock.

My purpose in making the tramp was  to gain experience in using the language and especially to make my self acquainted with ^the^ people and the general features of this, the principal island in the mission.  I feel well paid  for my effort.  I found the people as a whole very kind I was treated to the best they had.  At many places the poul- try yard suffered a loss in my behalf and the best bed in the house was always placed at my disposal.  They have all the  faults and failings common to their race, but I was  ENDENTRY pleased to note that they seemed ready to listen to my remarks on our gospel and appeared to take interest in the same but my knowlede of the language was not suf- ficient to do any real wordk in this line.  They claimed that we did not stay long enough with them for them to get acquainted with us and therefore we must  not expect them to be taking up with our views.  I think this quite true.  I understand from Bro. Cutler that ^this^ reason in writing the tract just published was to be able to begin real work here.  From what I gather of  the condition of the people throughout the islands I be- leive the tract system will be the most successful and think Bro. Cutler made a step in the right direction when he wrote his tract.  I beleive there isare openings to get the gospel before the people on this and think to begin with four  ENDENTRY elders could be used to advantage here.  This would  allow two elders on each side of the island.  I shall be  pleased to receive four elders in addition to those al- ready asked for as early as it will be convenient to get  them here.  Tahiti has a population of 10,113, it is 191 kilo- metres or 114 miles in cirumference.  The City of Papeete a- lone contains 4,288 leaving 5,825 scattered over the rest of the island.  With the exception of about 30 miles there is a good road.  This thirty miles is almost impassable and to  reach places there one would need to use boats.  Perhaps the following statement will be of interest to you. Tahiti has a population of 10,113 and we might soillegible has not  been worked.  It is true elders have been on Tahiti and most  of them I am informed have visited most of the island but it was before they under stood the language, and as soon as they were able to use the language and in most cases be- ENDENTRY fore that time; they were sent to the Tubuai Bro. Frank Atkinson Cutler|Cutler made an effort but or he was not allowed to use  the churches here to speak in he made no further effort in that  line but published the tract referred to with the intention of reach- ing the people that way but he returned home by the illegiblesail that brought the tracts.  Moorea has a population of 1,407.  No work has  been done there.  The Marquises Group has a population of 4,445 (by some authorities 7,500)  No work has been done there.  The Gambier Group 508.  No work done.  Rapa 182, no work done; The Leeward Group about 6,000 no work done Rimatara 550,  no work done;  Rurutu 730, one saint, 185 days work, Tubuai 429, 159 saints, well worked.  Tuamotus 4,743.  905 saints well worked.  Just over one fifth of these last two islands are "Mormons".  This shows a population of 35,380 or if  the greater population of Marquises in taken 28,435.

We have not used any native elders here so far.  I have been considering the matter for several months.  The islands are so scattered that they could not be used in a near vacinity of their homes.  They would need to go hundreds of miles from home on to other islands. illegible live virtuous lives they would be under the necessity ^of^ taking their families with them and there fore I have illegible that what little they would do would hardly be worth the effort I observe that the illegible sent one supported native elders to be at work on the islands ENDENTRY $300.00 Putland May 18th, 1854  Recd, from W.

Subscription Price, - 1.25 Per Annum, in Advance.  Andrew Jenson,  PUBLISHER OF  THE HISTORICAL RECORD.  OFFICE.—No. 154 N. Second West Street.  Salt Lake City, Utah, Sept. 23, 1889  President Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith.  Dear Brethren! Having now finished the  four volumes of the "Historical Record" in which I promised  the public to publish a certain kind ^class^ of historical infor- mation pertaining to the history of the Church, I feel it to be my privilege, and perhaps my duty, to consult  with you, before proceeding to lay other plans for the future.  Ever since I commenced my historical labors, about  13 years ago, I have been under the impression that my  work ought to be performed under the immediate supervision  of the Church Authorities, and that anything I published per-  taining to Church history should by them be subjected to the  strictest criticism before being printed.  Such was ^indeed^ the case as  long as I published in the Danish language, Elder Erastus  Snow being appointed by the late Pres. Brigham Young, and  subsequently by the late Pres. John Taylor, to supervise my  labors.  But since commencing the "Record," four years  ago, I have published on my own responsibility, no one  having been appointed to supervise my work. This, I may  say, has often grieved me, and although I have at times ENDENTRY taken the liberty to consult with Bro. Franklin D. Richards  and others of the Twelve, I have by no means done this  as often as I have felt a want to, as I did not wish  to intrude upon their time ^as long as I was engaged in a private enterprise.^ I am, however, now able  to place my ^last four years'^ work before you in a form that you in a  few minutes cemay be able to judge somewhat of its  merits, and ^also^ understand the nature of ^my^ ability as a  compiler of historical data and facts.  Having done so much I am now in ^such^ a position that  ^I can^ continue or discontinue my publication, according to your  council; but I am under the impression now more than  ever before, that my works ought to be published by  authority, or not be published at all. And in order to  make myself plain I hereby ask leave to state that  I am willing to devote my entire future life in the  interest of Church history, and I offer you my services, from the 1st of January next, with or without any  compensation of a material nature,  just as you desire;  and shall be willing to work at the Historian's Office  or travel through the country gathering historical  information, according to your best judgment. And I will ENDENTRY also leave with you to decide as to what had best be  done with the "Historical Record," hereby offering its  title, list of subscribers, and the good will of the Saints which it may have gained, as a free will donation to  the Church; and, if you accept of it, you may do with  it what you please. If it is continued by authority it has,  I think, not a bad foundation to stand on; and if stopped,  I trust its mission hitherto have resulted in good, and  that sometime in the future it, or something similar,  may again see the light of day.  During the last 18 months I have received from the  Church $5000 per month (from the Tithing Office), it being an allowance made in order to enable me ^to^ sustain my  family while gathering historical information concerning  the several Stakes of Zion etc. Not having access to the docu- mentary history of the Church, I have deemed it unwise  to publish the information thus far gained; and I propose  to deliver the manuscripts to the Church historian, together with a complete index to the history of Joseph Smith as published in the "Millennial Star."  tThis alone has cost me  month's of labor; and before I am through with my  ENDENTRY Copy of a letter from the First Presidency to President Wilford Woodruff. Salt Lake City, November 12th 1885 President Wilford Woodruff and Council of the Twelve Apostles Dear Brethren: Letters which we receive in response from those who are called to go on missions prompt us to communicate with you upon this subject. We are sending out a large number of missionaries in various directions and it is important that in making sel- ections we should get the best material available for the purpose. It is not unreasonable to suppose that many very worthy persons who would make excellent missionaries are overlooked, while many who are not so suitable are selected. It appears to us that this business of selecting missionaries can be more systematized, and be attended with more satisfactory results than it is at the present  time. The calls for missionaries should be considered by the Twelve Apostles. They should understand the fields to be supplied and the kind of men that are needed to supply them. At the present time they travel ENDENTRY PRESIDENT'S OFFICE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST. OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS.  P. O. BOX B. Salt Lake City, U. T.  Jany, 12th 1891  Prest. W.

The Deseret Historical Association, PUBLISHERS OF  THE HISTORICAL RECORD. OFFICE  No. 154 N. Second West Street.  ANDREW JENSON, Manager.  Salt Lake City, Utah, April 14 1890  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother!  Inclosed I send you copy of  Articles of Incorporation of the contemplated  Historical Association.  The capital stock ($10,000) divided into shares of $10 each may be changed ato $500  per share if preferable or raised to any other amount. I value my plant and subscription list and the  whole business, exclusive of historical documents, at  $2,500.  Of this amount I propose to let the Church  have $1,200, without further renumeration than that  I already have and am now receiving, and keep $1,000's  worth myself.  This gives the Church a controling  interest at once, leaving capital stock to the amount  of $7,800 to be disposed off as the company may deem  proper.  The proceeds of such sales could be applied toward erecting a fire-proof building in which to store  documents, etc., or in any other way that the company  might think proper.  I would suggest that the  members of the First Presidency, the Church historians and  other trustworthy men hold the Church shares in trust, as the law has does not allow the Church as a dissolved  ENDENTRY corporation to hold property of that kind at present. There need be no apprehension of the Association  falling behind financially, if the business of the  same is properly conducted.  On the contrary, if  worked up to a business standard, it can bring the  shareholders proper dividends.  But I feel the  load to be too heavy for me to carry alone.  I should prefer to have nothing to do with the management  of the business, but devote all my time to historical labors.  I think an able and reliable business  man can be found who would conduct the affairs of  the Association in a manner that will be satis- factory and beneficial.  Anxiously awaiting your decision and early  answer in this matter I remain  Your Brother in the Gospel,  Andrew Jenson.

ENDENTRY Glasgow Scotland, May 19, 1897.  Prest. Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother!  I expect to embark from this  port (Glasgow) on Saturday next, the 22nd inst., on the  steamer "City of Rome," homeward bound, taking  with me a large number of Church records. I  have just means enough with me to pay my fare  to New York. Will you kindly telegraph me trans- portation from New York to Salt Lake City, as I  shall be almost pennyless on my arrival in that  city. I shall call immediately on Mr. R. Tenbroek, 86 Broadway, New York. Being with a small  company of Saints and returning Elders, I shall  endeavor to get the records through without  overweight charges. Should such mbe made, however,  I have no means with me to defray the expense.  I have finished my labors in the European  Mission, with the exception of the conference in  Norway. I had expected to go there, but find  myself obliged to return at once. I have been  away over two years. My health is good, and I  feel well, though fatigued through lack of rest and  through working too many hours, perhaps, being anxious to get through. But I shall be able to rest  while crossing the ocean. If I am required to  pay my fare from New York to Salt Lake City, my  wife will call and do so at once; but please do  not keep me waiting in New York.  Your Brother in the Gospel,  Andrew Jenson. ENDENTRY Paris, France. Nov 30th 1892.  Pres. Willford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon, Joseph F. Smith.  Dear Brethren:  Your welcome favor of Nov 12th was gladly rec'd. The check for 765 Francs. ($150) that you enclosed, is all what is necessary to meet my expenses at present, and as you have arranged to send the rest of the money in install- ments it is better than if you had send me the whole amount at once.  I am ever so grateful for the opportunity which is given to me, to remain here a ENDENTRY little longer and continue my studies. I utilize my time to the best advandage and try to profit of all the opportunities given to the student here in this great metropolis of art.  The material and knowledge I gather is such, which I think will be most useful to the Church in the advance- ment of God's Kingdom here upon the earth, it is always my desire to do the best I can and add my mite to the great work in which I am engaged.  Trusting to hear from you again in the course of time.  I am your humble brother  Herman H. Haag. ENDENTRY P.S. Please adress:  H. Haag, Acadimie Julien 31 Rue du Dragon Paris. ENDENTRY Gates, Susie Y.  Laie. Aug. 24th 1888.  Wilford Woodruff, Pres. of the Church of Latter-Day Saints:  Dear Brother:  There is a weighty matter which I wish to lay before you, and upon which I desire your  counsel and decision. I humbly pray the Spirit of the Lord may dictate my words and pen:  Perhaps a brief outline or history of the subject will be as fitting an introduction as any I might choose.  Sometime last winter, in January I believe, my husband and I were discussing the future as it related to my literary labors and aspirations. I had been making an effort to introduce some of my articles in the Eastern magazines with the hope that in a quiet and humble way, I might place before the reading public of America the real facts of the Mormon ENDENTRY cause, more especially in regard to women and the great priviledges which are theirs in the gosple.  In remarking upon the future possi- bilities of Jacob said to me that it would please him to see the time I now spend in literary efforts in so many directions, centered in some place where it would be productive of a greater good. He further re- marked that he would like to see me associated with Sister E. B. Wells in the labors of the Exponent pub- lication.  This was a very novel idea to me, as ^in^ all my hopes and plans for the future no thought had ever occurred to me of editing or assiting to edit a magazine had ever occurred to me. But the more I studied over the mat- ter, the more it seemed to open up before me. I had wished and hoped to ever use my talent in doing good; or as Aunt Eliza Snow once affection- ENDENTRY ately remarked to me, to "never write a word nor line that is not calcu- lated to build up this Kingdom." Heretofore, however, my aims were all individual ones. Now a new and broader field was presented before me.  At length, (in February), I acted upon the suggestion of my husband and by his advice, addressed a private letter to Dr. Roumania B. Pratt, who was an dear old friend, and who was also acquainted with matters pertaining to the interests of the R.S. and its organ, the Exponent. The wish of my husband was stated, and a number of questions asked relative to the Board and management of the Exponent, and of ^to^ the possibility of my obtaining a position under Sister Wells. It will be needless to relate anything further of my desires in that direction, as I wish to come at once to the answer I received from ENDENTRY Dr. Pratt in June last.  She apologizes for her long delay and assures me that she has thought much and often on my letter and its contents. Answering in part my ques- tions, she discourages my attempts to get upon the Exponent, her main rea- son for so so objecting I will copy in her own words. She says: "But I suggest that you branch out, and take the fruitful and waiting field of a Monthly Magazine of the Y.L. M.I. Association, and show up to the world the immense and brilliant work that is piling up like a mag- nificent coral reef of intelligence and which is pouring forth from these Associations continually. Why are not the Young Ladie's Works, re- presented, and recorded, and handed down to posterity as well as the Y. M.I.M.I.A.s? Echo answers, because there is no one as yet has had the energy to commence the work. In- ENDENTRY stead of the mormon women having to fight for rights, it seems to me they should be up and bestiring them- selves to make use of all the priv- iledges and opportunities lying around waiting for utilization. Now I have felt for a long time a wide and fertile field of usefulness and of great value to our people, is lying dormant in this direction. If the essays and sayings and doings of the Y.L.M.I.A.'s and were represent- ed and sent forth to the world, no one would dare call our women ignorant and low, except they possessed the brain of a cayuse.  Now, my dear Susie, here is a field in which you could do much good. . . . . . I have many times asked the question of different ones, and the in- variable answer is, where is the woman to do it? Now, my advice to you is, to go about this thing quietly, only laying ENDENTRY the matter before the proper authorities Every good work has its opposition, but when a good thing is actually done and before the people, it will speak for itself, and its victory and place won. The R.S.'s and I sincerely think the Y.L.M.I. A.'s have arrived at the magnitude of a proper representation. Write me again about this matter. I have men- tioned it to no one concerning you. (P. S.) Provo would be as good da place  for headquarters of such a publica- tion as the R. B. Pratt." Thus ends the letter.  Here then was an entirely new sug- gestion. Upon reflection, my hus- band decided that if the Presidency of the Church and the Authorities and members of the Y.L.M.I.A.'s felt to add their co-operation and faith to such a scheme, he was  willing I should undertake to ENDENTRY fulfill a portion of that mission. Accordingly, I wrote a letter setting these matters forth to one who has been a friend and brother to us, and whose counsel would be dictated by the Spirit of the Lord; that brother was Pres. Joseph F. Smith. We have just received his reply, in which he refers us to yourself, adding that he is favorable to such an enterprize as has been suggested by Dr. Pratt. His letter also contains many wise suggestions and hints, which it will be my pleasant duty to act upon should the occasion ever arise for me to so do.  There are many details connected with such a scheme which of course could only be arranged in connection with those who would hereafter be appointed to decide such matters.  I have taken the liberty to mention ENDENTRY some of my thoughts and ideas in re- gard to this subject in the enclosed letter to the Presidency of the Y.L. M.I.A.  I would be pleased if you would kindly read the letter f in con- nection with this, so that you may understand my motives and wishes for ^in^ this object.  If, Pres. Woodruff, you and your associate Council feel to endorse the suggestion of Dr. Pratt; and if, which concerns me personally, you can feel that I am a fit and  worthy one to put in such a grave position and trust, will you please hand the enclosure so addressed to the Presidency of the Y.L.M.  I.A.'s.  Let me then cease to further trespass  upon your time, with the fervent and humble prayer that your words shall be, even the Word of the Lord, on this momentous question. Let me ENDENTRY further add my humble great desire for your health and long- continued usefulness on this earth. In which my husband cordially joins. With respect and high esteem  I remain Your sister in the Gosple  Susa Young Gates. ENDENTRY Susa Y. Gates 24 Aug. 1888, ansd Oct 2 1888.  Address Honolulu, Box 410 O'ahu. Sandwich Islands.

Smith  Dear Brethren:  I feel impressed, after having written  a letter to Bro. Franklin D. Richards, to pen a few lines to  the First Presidency, also, by way of reporting my labors so  far, briefly. Leaving Salt Lake City on May 11, 1895, I arri- ved at Honolulu, Hawaii, on the 29th of the same month, and I then spent about two months in the Hawaiian  Mission, gathering historical notes, and visiting the diffe- rent islands and branches of the Church in order to  obtain the desired information. Thence I went to Fiji, where I spent ten days waiting for an opportunity to  continue my voyage to Tonga, but put in that time  to good advantage, the details of which I have already  reported to Bro. Richards. I spent three weeks with  the brethren in the Tongan Mission, and thence passed  on to Samoa, where I was busily engaged nearly a  month visiting the different islands and branches for  historical purposes, and also preaching to the people. My  next field of labor was New Zealand, where I arrived on  Oct. 11, 1895, and commenced soon afterwards a very exten- sive tour to all the districts of that mission in company  with Elder Wm. Gardner, who presides over the Australa- sian Mission. We traveled together by land and by sea  about 3000 miles, held district conferences and other  meetings in the different districts, while I at the same time  obtained my historical information and inspected the re- spective branch and district records. On Jan. 23, 1896, I sailed ---------------------  Elder Frank Cutler wishes to be remembered to the Presidency  ENDENTRY from Auchland, New Zealand, for the Society Islands Mis- sion, and arrived at Tahiti and  of all the French possessions in Polynesia, on the 3rd inst. Since I left home I have traveled nearly 18,000 miles, have preached about 120 times, and attended to considerable  other missionary labors, besides historical work. My health  has been good throughout, and I have enjoyed my labors, and  feel that the Lord has abundantly blessed me so far. I have  also been successful in obtaining transportation so far. ^hitherto.^  In some instances I have had free and at other times half  fare transportation. I have always traveled first-class on the ships, and have endeavored to take advantage of  the situation and my surroundings, by conversing ^freely^ with my  fellow passengers concerning our people and their religion. On three occasions I lectured in the cabins on board ships,  to very attentive audiences. My associations with the Elders  in the different missions that I have visited has been of  the most pleasant kind, and the presidents and secretaries of  missions, and other ^Elders^ have assisted me considerably in copying  for me and otherwise getting data and information for me ^Church^. The great need of improvements in record-keeping, both at  home and abroad, becomes more and more apparent, as I  proceed with my work. I have worked hard, if I am to be  judged by my fellow laborers, and still it takes me much longer  than I expected when I left home. After visiting the principal is- lands of this mission I proceed to Au- stralia, and the Suez Canal. Ever praying for the welfare of Zion  and that special blessings may be granted the First Presidency of  the Church, in their ardous and very responsible  labors, I remain Your Brother in Christ,  Andrew Jenson.  sideways text Andrew Jenson Feb. 5 1896 end of sideways text ENDENTRY P.S.

Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon  and Joseph F. Smith.  Dear Brethren!  Having spent now  already upwards of one year traveling  among the Saints in the different  Stakes of Zion in the interest of Church  history, since receiving my special  appointment in April, 1891, I feel  impressed to present you with a  brief summary of my labors:  During the past twelve or thirteen  months—from April 22, 1891, to May 16, 1892—I have visited every settlement  and branch of the Church in eleven  Stakes of Zion, namely the Box Elder,  Sevier, Panquitch, Summit, Morgan Bear Lake, Cache, Kanab, St. George, Parowan and Beaver Stakes, which together  embrace 177 organized wards and branches. ENDENTRY To reach these settlements, I have traveled  4684 miles, namely 942 miles by rail, 3737 by team and 5 on foot. I have  preached 189 times, mostly in special  meetings appointed for the purpose; besides  meeting with the old settlers and others (in all the settlements visited) in small gatherings  to which such parties who were wanted  were specially invited. By this means  I have been enabled to gather ^successful in obtaining^ the histori- cal information that will enable me  to write histories of all the Stakes and  settlements I have visited so far.  Previous to receiving my special  appointment, in May, 1891, I had visited  already for the same purpose as above stated, the Cassia, Bannock, Oneida, Sanpete and  Emery Stakes, containing 71 settlements, which  added to the eleven Stakes visited during the last year, make 616 Stakes visited so far, embracing altogether 248 settlements of  the Saints, or just one half of all the  Stakes organized at the present time. ENDENTRY In visiting the Stakes I have generally  proceeded in the following manner: First  I would go directly to the headquarters of  the Stake to consult with the members of  the Stake Presidency, in connection with  whom I would arrange a regular traveling  programme and a string of appointments  for visiting the several wards and branches. According to this I would generally hold an evening meeting for the general public  in which I would give general instructions, and then appoint a special meeting of the  old settlers, ward clerk and secretaries of  the different associations, with their records,  to meet with me the next morning to  impart such information as would be re- quired. These historical meetings would  last from three to six hours as a rule;  and after getting through I would imme- diately proceed to the next settlement  to go through the same routine there. Almost universally the leading brethren  and people generally have responded  ENDENTRY cheerfully when called upon to give infor- mation; and I have also been treated  with kindness and hospitality wherever  I have been, with one or two exceptions. I have paid my own railway fare, and  borne all my traveling expenses, including  the purchasing of a new buggy; and in  most of the Stakes I have traveled  with my own conveyances.  After my experience so far ^up to the present^, and  after getting thoroughly acquainted with  the condition of affairs in all the places  I have visited so far, I am sorry to  report that in most places I have found  the different kinds of records in a  very deplorable, neglected condition; in  many instances no regular records are  being kept at all, and those few who  are kept are as a rule kept without  system or order. Nearly all the early  records kept in the several wards and  branches have long ago been lost, misplaced or destroyed entirely, and con- ENDENTRY sequently about half the members of  the Church are in perfect ignorance  to-day as regards the date of their  blessings, baptisms, confirmations, ordi- nations, etc., as most of them have  relied on the records that are lost  for this information  In all my travels I have, both in my private and public in- structions, endeavored to empress upon  the members of the Church the  necessity of keeping track of their  own baptisms, ordinations, etc., and  have recommended that each family  keep a family record of some kind,  in which to record all important  matters pertaining to the family and  every individual member thereof. These instructions have generally been well  received, and the necessity of doing  this acknowledged generally, although  many, including men filling prominent  positions in the Church, have said that  ENDENTRY they never thought of the matter  before in the light in which I presented  it, and never understood, till their  attention was drawn to it, that any  such thing was required of them.  I have endeavored to follow  strictly the instructions I have received  from Apostle Richards, the Church historian, but as the memories of most people are  in such a condition that only a small  portion of what is listened to or  learned can be retained for any  length of time, I fear that my labors  in many instances will only have a  temporary effect. And therefore I take  the liberty to suggest, that a circulary  letter issued by the First Presedency, ^or^ the  Church historian, or both, setting forth in  plainness what is required by the  Stake, ward and branch clerks, as well  as heads of families and individual  members, in regard to keeping records, would make a deeper impression, and  ENDENTRY have a more lasting effect, besides  being the means of introducing uni- formity and system in record keeping  throughout all the Stakes of Zion.  Should you desire a more  detailed report of my labors, I am  prepared to give such, either verbally  or by further communication.  In the meantime I remain your earnest co-laborer and  brother in the Gospel of Christ,  Andrew Jenson.

Salt Lake City, Utah, July 27, 1891  President Wilford Woodruff Dear Brother!  Yesterday, I received the inclosed pamphet by mail, with a request of replying to it.  Is it worth a while to do so?  The writer  seems to be a "remnant" of the Strangites.  Traveling continually, as I now do, in  the interest of Church history and for the Church,  I find that my railway fare amounts to quite  considerable.  As long as I published the  "Record" I had free transportation, but that paper  now being suspended, of course I no longer, on that  account, can expect to receive such courtesies. Could not Bro. Spence get me passes on the U.P. system and the Rio Grande Western, in consideration  of the nature of my work, and also missionary labor  that I naturally perform where ever I go?  I  would also like to have the use of the Deseret  State Telegraph Line in matters pertaining to  Church affairs.  It would occasionally come in con- venient to send messages ahead when letters would  not reach in time, and thus, by preparing the people ENDENTRY or presiding officers of my coming.  I would be  able to accomplish more in the same length of  time.  I intend to start for the Bear Lake Stake on Monday morning next, and if anything can be done  for my transportation, I would like very much to have  it done before I start off on mythat trip, on which I  would have to travel on the Union Pacific.

President Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Brother:  Your letter of the 9th inst. came to hand this morning, and in reply to  the same I will say that as soon as I received  brother Sjödahl's translation of the Doctrine and  Covenants I began to compare it with the ori- ginal and have since devoted all my spare  evenings to the work. I have gone through with  about one-third of it, and find it thus far very  good. Now and then an expression occurs that  seems foreign to the Gospel and out of harmony  with the original, which renders it necessary to  compare every sentence, so as to avoid wrong  impressions and faulty doctrines; but taking  the translation all in all, with this exception, it  is very good. I would prefer to go through  with at least one-half before it is put in type,  as my time is very limited, and I may not  be able to keep ahead of the printing, if it were commenced now. If you wish me to hurry the  matter up I will use Sundays as well and then ENDENTRY the printing could be commenced any time you  may decide upon, and if brother Sjödahl wishes  to go through the manuscript again he can do  so any time; only I think it would be better  for me to keep ahead of him also.  With kindest regards to yourself and President George Q. Cannon, I remain,  Your Brother  A. W. Carlson ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, March 10th, 1893.  President Wilford Woodruff, City.  Dear Brother:  As you kindly set aside one evening last Conference for  the benefit of the German people, in order that they hear the words of  the Lord in their own tongue, and being ever mindful of their best  interests, we feel encouraged to again ask you for the same great pri- vilege during the coming Conference.  Very many of the German Saints know little or nothing of  the English language, and desiring that they are fully impressed with  the teachings as well as the spirit of the Conference, we respectfully  present this matter to you, trusting you will be able to act favorably  thereon.  We will call upon you for an answer.  Your Brother in the Gospel,  Arnold H. Schulthess  In Behalf of the German Saints.  Granted 7th Apl ENDENTRY Lorus Pratt.  45 Rue Mazerine Paris France. April 16th, 1892.  Prest. Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Bro: I received your letter of March 26th on the 10th inst. with check enclosed for Two hHundred ($200 00/100) Dol- lars. I also recieved the ($20000) which you sent on the 9th of last January, and promptly acknoweledged the same in  my letter to bro. Cannon of January  26th or 28th, giving full particulars of our situation. I also wrote him a- gain on the 8th or 9th of February for fear he might not get the other one,  which apparently must have lain ^there^ awaiting his return from Washington.  In bro Cannon's letter of Sept. 12th,  of last year, he enclosed $300 00/100 ^out^ of $500 00/100 which he stated had been appropriated and that he would send "the remain- ing $20000 "after while." We waited for this as long as we thought it would be safe to do when I sent the first telegram.  On the arrival of this amount I immediate- -ly replied stating that we would barely ENDENTRY we would barely have enough to last us, until we could hear from him again,  being already in debt for schooling rRent andc.  Of course this small sum could not go far among 5 persons but feeling sure that bro my letters and send means to relieve us, we again waited until the last resort, when we bor- rowed $20 00 of a missionary who came this way and sent the last telegram. We have tried to be very economical and I can assure you that we were especial- ly so during these periods of suspension —living on from 15 to 20 cents a day.  (This amount will appear very small when we consider that it costs as much to live in Salt Lake City, various reports to the contrary not withstand- ing.)  In answer to your question as to how much longer we purpose remain- ing here, I will state that, at the end of the first, we asked permission to stay an- other year in the reply ^of Mar 7th 1891,^ a willingness was expressed that we "have" our "liberty as to  the time that" we would "stay." "if it be not too ENDENTRY long." We had accordingly decided to remain aone year which time will be up on the 24th of July next. At the same time holding ourselves ready to come home any time you saw fet for us to do so. Telling that the source was in a sense gratuitous we have felt very deli- cate about naming any certain am amounts that we might need, preferring to leave it to the judgement of yourself and brethren through whose ^kindness and^ generosity we are here. I sometimes think that it  might have been better if we could have made arrangements ^for^ such amounts. We are satisfied however, and do not feel to complain, although it has been a mat- ter of inconvenience to us, not to know what to depend on—but very sorry indeed, that we have been the cause of an- noyance and expense to you. There are 5 of us now instead of 3 and the small amounts sent do not reach very far. I have made a careful estimate based upon my total expenses for the time I have been here and find that it averages ENDENTRY about fifty dollars per month or $600 00 a year. This would veary some accord- ing to the course of study. A strictly academic one is not so expensive, especially the first year as one's time is spent mostly drawing and the ma- terial costs very little compared with that used in painting. I also took a course in landscape painting  which ^is^ a great deal more expensive than that at school, comparatively.  I wrote bro Cannon that I should like to go to Italy before returning home if it met with your views, preferring to cut my time at Paris two or three months short for that purpose. I mentioned the sum that ^it^ would take, not calculating on my expenses for Salon work which I  did not know of at the time of writing.  Add fifty $5000to the amount given in the letter, making $45000, which will pay my expenses for night, schooling art ^and Frames^ material andc. take me to Italy and home. Bro.

My schooling runs out tomorrow, where I will do some copying at the Luxemburg and Louvre while waiting for your reply to this letter. If I go to  Italy I desire to get ^arrive^ there before it gets too hot, and should consider it a favor, if I may have the privelege of going, if the  amount named for myself could be sent in time for the purpose. I mentioned  it in my letter to bro. Cannon.  We hardly know how to express the gratitude we fell feel in our hearts for the  brethren who have so kindly assisted us ENDENTRY and the opportunity we have thus had.  I feel satisfied that the means thus spent if it should not be too great a strain for the Church will bring a blessing upon Zion in developing the talents of her worthy sons, who in turn will be an impetus to the cause of art, which if divine should be eminently developed among the people of God.  We continue to hold our mee- tings regularly and assure you that in our isolation from the main body of the Church, we find a ^source of^ consolation and comfort in such ^a^ privelege.

Salt Lake City, Utah Feb. 18 1888 President Wilford Woodruff and  Members of the Quorum of the  Twelve Apostles.  Dear Brethren!  I feel impressed to write again  to the Council of the Twelve concerning my  historical labors.  Hitherto I have received no  material aid from any source whatever, except  from ^the^ general subscription fees from regular  subscribers; and neither can I consistantly look  for any such encouragement from any public  funds outside the Church, as long as I confine  my labors to ecclesiastical affairs.  Among the  tasks which I have already accomplished, and to  which I like to draw your espescial attention is  the history of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion, including  histories of all the wards, etc., which I have published  in the "Historical Record", a copy of which I here  with present the Council. (See pages 273-343.) I contemplate writing up all the other Stakes in  a similar manner, but in order to this I need some  ENDENTRY material aid, as it will be impossible for me under  the present circumstances to derive sufficient from regular subscribers, to bear expenses of printing, etc., and  live besides, while doing it.  I feel safe in saying  that if the Church should have employed men to  hunt up dates and facts - perusing all old records and  documents to be formed, as I have done - the compiling  of the history of ^the^ Salt Lake CityStake alone would have  cost it (the Church) thousands of dollars; and in  writing up the other Stakes, much more expenses  would have to be incurred; and a great deal of traveling  in visiting all the scattered settlements in the  Territory be necessary.  In view of all this - and  I need not try to point out the necessity of the work  being done - I feel myself justified in kindly asking  the Council of the Twelve to do something for me  in a material way to aid me in my labors. If provisions could be made for me to draw about $5000 pr. month from the General Tithing Office;  toward the support of my family for the next two  years, I think I shall be able to accomplish the selfimposed  ENDENTRY task of completing the Church Encyclopadia which  I have promised the public.  Hoping, dear brethren, that you will give this  matter your earliest attention, and give me an  answer, I remain  Your Brother in the Gospel, Andrew Jenson.  P.S. I will add that I wrote to the  Council some time ago, but did not  receive any answer.  A. J.  ENDENTRY Andrew Jenson Oct 29 1893.  L. D. S. Historian's Office, P. O. BOX 1678,  Salt Lake City, Utah, Oct. 29 1893  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother:  Being about to  start out on a tour to the settlements of the  Saints constituting the San Juan and the  San Luis Stakes of Zion, in the interest of  Church history, I would like to ask you, if  you have any special instructions to give me? In visiting other distant Stakes, I have found  the people actually famishing for the bread  of life. They are hardly ever visited by any of  the general authorities of the Church, and if  any of these ever do happen along, they will  general ^usually^ attend a quarterly conference where  but a very small proportion of the people  from distant settlements meet, and then take  their departure again. When I visit ^go to^ a Stake,  I have to visit every town and village in it,  which gives me an opportunity to see nearly all  the people, as they are called together to receive  some special instructions about record keeping, etc,  which I am supposed to impart to them. But  beyond this, I have received no instructions ENDENTRY from you or Brother Richards. I have  seen many opportunities for doing good  by preaching the Gospel to the people on  general principles, especially to the young,  but not having been instructed or ap- pointed to do anything of the kind, I have  nearly always confined myself to my historical  work and instructions. Whether you have in- tended that I should thus confine myself, I  do not know; but I do not wish to trans- cend my bounds, and hence have acted prudently  in this matter. If you in my future journeyings  in the Stakes of Zion desire me to extend  my field of usefulness by bringing the people  any special message from head-quarters or preach  the Gospel, I shall be pleased to receive your  instructions, and I will endeavor to carry them  out to the best of my ability. Concerning the  conditions of the Church records in the diffe- rent Stakes and Wards in Zion I will simply  say, that if you and your Counselors and  the Twelve knew the general neglect and  carelessness in this regard, you would, I think,  feel very uneasy; and perhaps take steps looking  to a general reformation in this regard. I have  done my best by giving suggestions; but this I am sure  will only partly remedy the evil. Your Brother  in the Gospel.  Andrew Jenson. ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Utah, July 3, 1897. Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Joseph F. Smith  Dear Brethren: Having now almost completed my  travels (as planned a few years ago) in the various Stakes of Zion  and in all our missionary fields throughout the world (outside the United States) this may be a fitting opportunity to make  a condensed report of my operations and travels during the past ten years.  The historical labors which I have performed  directly for the Church actually commenced in 1888, when I  visited all important places connected with the history of  our people in the States of Missouri.  In 1889 I visited a number of the settlements of the  Saints in Millard counties, gathering  historical information.  In 1890, for a similar purpose, I visited the  Idaho, and the  Utah.  In 1891, I was regularly engaged by the Church as  a historian, and given letters of instructions and intro- duction to presiding officers in the Church, after which I com- menced a more thorough and systematic work, and going much more into details. During the year I visited the several  wards in the Morgan Cache Stakes.  In 1892, I visited all the wards and branches of the Church in the Uintah ^Stakes^.  ENDENTRY In 1893, Davis,  San Luis Stakes, and also made a  second historical tour to the States, visiting places of historical interest to our people in the States of Nebraska, etc.  In 1894, I made a tour of the St. John Stakes, the Mexican Mission, and the Maricopa  Stakes, returning by way of California. Later in the year  I visited the settlements of the Saints in Canada, and in  the Bannock Stake, and also traveled and labored in the  Salt Lake Stake.  In 1895, I finished my labors in the Stakes of Zion,  and in May started on my foreign mission to continue my labors abroad. During the remainder of the year I  labored in the Sandwich Islands Mission, the Tongan  Mission, the Samoan Mission and the New Zealand  Mission.  In 1896, I visited the Society Islands Mission and the Australian Mission. Then, after visiting Ceylon,  Italy, I continued my histo- rical labors in Sweden Switzerland.  In 1897 I finished my labors in the Swiss and Ger- man Mission, then labored in the Hollandish and in the  British Mission, and returned home June 4th last,  having been absent from home two years and one month.  On my extensive travels I have collected a vast  amount of historical information by perusing the records and ENDENTRY documents which have accumulated in the various stakes of Zion, and the respective missionary fields, and also by culling from private journals and interviewing many persons of note  and long experience in the Church. I have also sent and brought to the Historian's Office hundreds of records from foreign missio- nary fields, which were not needed abroad any more, and many  more such records, which I packed for shipment in different places, can be expected here soon with returning Elders.  My notes being gathered under different conditions,  and under many difficulties—often hurriedly—need care- ful compilation and arrangement, before they can be used for  history. They, however, constitute the foundation and outline of for histories of nearly every Stake, ward, branch, quorum, association etc., of the Church in it's gathered state, and of every mission,  conference, branch, etc., abroad from the organization of the  Church to the present time. To bring all this into readable  shape will necesssarily require years of patient toil and labor.  In some of my previous reports I have alluded to the very imperfect state of our records as kept of late years through-  out the Church. I would earnestly recommend a thorough  reformation in regard to record keeping. There is a lack of system  and uniformity throughout the Church in the recording of ordinance  work and in the making of minutes, rolls, statistical reports, fi- nancial reports, etc. Each mission, Stake and ward seem to  have its own peculiar system or no system at all; and until  regular forms and blanks are furnished from headquarters for  use throughout the entire Church, this irregularity must necessarily  ENDENTRY continue. Our so-called genealogical books or registers of members now somewhat in general use in the Bishop's wards in the  different Stakes are, in my estimation, out of date intirely,  and do not answer the purpose for which they were intended, and our statistical blanks are worse still and ought, in my  judgment, to be condemned at once, in favor of something better. If the forms that I submitted to the Church historian about  three years ago, and which I have endeavored to introduce abroad, is not acceptable, I would suggest the appoint- ment of a special committee to prepare forms, blanks, etc., and  upon their adoption by the First Presidency, the historian  and general Church recorders make them universal through- out the Church, both at home and abroad.  In my researches and observations I have also discovered that a great number of false and inaccurate dates and statements are continually creeping into our wri- tings and records. In the absence of original records, or  owing to carelessness in consulting these, many people attempt  to give dates and other technical matters from memory,  which in most instances, when critizised, are found to be  incorrect. Thus, more than half of our missionaries, when requested to give in their geneaology at the Historian's  office, give in wrong dates for their baptisms, or no  dates at all; and the same is the case when genealogies for ward and quorum books are obtained. This un- pleasant feature, I think, could be avoided in the future if all members were required to produce certificates of ENDENTRY baptisms, ordinations, etc., the same as members of other denominations, and the same as was done in our  Church at an earlier date.  I return home from my foreign mission in  good health and spirits, though somewhat tired  and fatigued. I feel that the Lord has blessed  me and crowned my efforts with success. With a  few exceptions the presiding officers of the Church,  both at home and abroad have treated me kindly  and assisted me in different ways to prosecute  my labors.  Your Brother and Fellow-Laborer,  Andrew Jenson.

You will  remember the circumstances  connected with the contract  referred to.  And I would  also remind you that Bro. Willdon said he would  charge nothing for his  information, or labor in  assisting me, if the matter  was wanted for Church  purposes only; but if used  in Utah  he wanted $50.  Shall  I pay him $50 out of my own pocket, or will you make ENDENTRY matters all right with him? I believe the information has  not been used in the history  named, and an explanation  from you direct to Bro. Willden to this effect, would  perhaps be satisfactory to  him.  The contract I signed  read as follows:  "Beaver, Utah, Jany 29, 1892, I, the undersigned hereby  agree to pay Ellott Willden, of  Beaver Fifty Dollars ($5000) in Cash and to secure him a  copy of the history of Utah, when published, for some historical  information given me by him; provided the same is to be  used, in part, or in full, for Bishop Andrew Jenson".  I would kindly ask you  to give this matter your earliest  ENDENTRY attention, by either writing  Bro. Willden direct, or direct  me what to do on the  matter, as I will not  break my word with him.

Salt Lake City, Utah, August 8, 1887  President Wilford Woodruff and  Quorum of Twelve Apostles.  Dear Brethren:  I feel impressed to lay a matter before you which,  in my estimation is of vital importance, not only to me  personally, but to the whole Church; and I trust that  you in the multiplicity of your other business, and in  the midst of the responsibilities now resting upon your  Quorum, may find time to give it due consideration.  I respectfully draw your attention to the inclosed  "Prospectus" which I issued one year and a half ago. By this you will see that I have entered upon a  large field, and that ^when^ such a work as the one contem- plated shall have been completed, it will be very  valuable as a work of reference. Since issuing the  "Circular" I have published 19 numbers of the  "Historical Record" and thus made a good beginning  and before the present volume is completed I shall have published the history of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion,  biographical sketches of the Quorum of the Twelve  Apostles, and it's individual members, and those of  ENDENTRY other leading and historical men in the Church, as  well as other matters; but the greatest labors is yet to be  accomplished. I commenced my historical labors about  eleven years ago. The History of Joseph Smith, "Kirkens Historic" History of the Scandinavian mMission, etc.,  in Danish, hasve been the results of my labors, and I think these works have been appreciated by all who have  read them intelligently. Throughout, it has been a  labor of love, performed while struggling to get daily  bread. I feel, however, that the Lord has blessed  me and acknowledged my labors; and I think that  the time has come when my efforts might be en- couraged a little more than it has ^been^ in the past, and my burthen thus be made lighter; and in this  connection I wish to say that it would be agreeable  to my feelings to be employed by the Church as an  assistant to it's Church Historians, so that in all  my travels, labors and researches I might have the  satisfaction of knowing that I am properly authorised  and that the undertaking, instead of being looked upon as  a personal affair, is done ^by and^ for the benefit of the whole community. ENDENTRY Furthermore the Church would receive considerable  financial benefit from the publication of the  "Record" as in the hands of the Church Historians  and ^by^ being published as an authentic work, it  would get a very large circulation at once,  whereas in the hands of private individuals, it  has to struggle for existance like every other  literary enterprise in this ^small^ community. I could give  good reasons for stating this. I hope, dear  brethren, that you will understand my motives. I  desire to continue my historical labors in the interest of  the Church, but I think that the nature of my works is intitled to more recognition thatn it has had  hitherto, and that my struggling for an existance is  all lost ^out of place^ and inneccessary, as what little ability I may  possess could be turned to better advantage if the change suggested was made. Hoping that you will, at your  earliest convenience, consider this matter, and praying  God to bless you, the brethren of the Twelve, with the  necessary light and intelligence for your station and calling, I remain Your Brother and Fellow laborer  Andrew Jenson.

Brother Layton was completely overcome in his feelings of gratitude to you. your expressions of kindness in this as well as in other respects is greater than he expected. With regards to his health Brother Layton is failing gradually; two or three days ago he had a very severe attack, he as well as our-selves thought his time had come; he rallied however and on Tuesday 8th his birthday, he was unusually bright, The  large room where he lays was filled with people, the grown members of his family  and a few others who came in to celebrate the ENDENTRY anniversary of his birth. It is remarkable how well he keeps up under existing circumstances.  there is a most excellant spirit pervading the people of this Stake of Zion, as expressed  by a good old brother today. the apostles brought it  with them and it has never left; besides the  most excellant spirit of union and love that exists there is a spirit of public enterprise and private improvement that is very commendable; there has been at least two thousand shade trees set out since  conference, and following the suggestions of the apostles each ward is endeavoring to have a public grove.  The Board of Education set out about 120 trees on  the academy grounds. The health of the people  generally is good; the weather is beautiful, prospects are favorable for both fruit and grain crops.  With kind regards. Very Respectfully.  Your Brother.

The bishops ^and^ stake offices reports  showed plainly a marked improvement in this Stake of Zion  since the Apostles were here: there is not a dissenting voice throughout the stake that we know of; the  spirit of union and love seems to exist in every quorum.  The saints have tried hard to follow out councils  recieved; a large majority of them are keeping the Words  of wisdom, and all the offices do. As you may know from remittances sent to your office and according to the quarterly report made to the Presiding Bishopric, there is scarcely anything on hand in the tithing, the people  have paid librally, and the bishopric have converted almost everything into cash. The donations now paid on our fast days are almost sufficient to meet the demands of our few poor and it will only be a matter of a  short time until we will not need one cent of tithing) ENDENTRY all (for this purpose. The bishops are endeavoring to  utilize the lesser priesthood and give them a proper  training. Our Relief Societies, Sunday Schools, Primary Y.M. and Y. L. Associations are reported in a healthy con- dition, the latter two however have ajourned for the  summer season, taking up the time of their former meeting in missionary classes which have been  organized in almost every ward and are doing excel- lant work. In Thatcher last nights class over which I have the pleasure of presiding in connection with  two of my brethren we have an enrollment of over  seventy young men and women; these class exercises  are purely on the principles of the Gospel with the  purpose of training our youth for missionary work. Never in the history of our valley have we had better prospects for an abundant harvest of fruit and grains,  we are already eating luscious apricots, Peaches and Plums,  our harvesters and thrashers are at work our valleys resounding  with them of machinery taking care of the grains.  Immediately following the fields are turned over again and large fields of corn are planted.) ENDENTRY all (In response to a call made by our Governor there have  been some few volunteers to assist our government in the  present war but in consequence of our position on the  border and newly and sparcely settled country, we have not many young men to spare. As a local protection of our citizens and property we have organized home guards in each of our settlements very much after  the order of the old style with captains over 10, 100 and  1000, and summoned in the old style by a bass drum;  Saturday afternoons are set apart as a day of recreation and cleaning up for sunday at which time our brethren  are directed and drilled by some of our older brethren of former years. The brethren have laid out candid   means for the latest improved army guns;  you will understand we are on the borders of Mexico and have many Mexican and Spanish citizens and  many of the government troops who have been keeping under subjection the Apache and other tribes of  indians on the reservations have been withdrawn  to aid in the war making us feel a little unsafe without local protection.

I selected three of our bishops giving us  controll, a majority of the board; we have now made every preparation to accompany the surveyor on the 15th in a preliminary survey, after which several of my  brethren and myself will follow up this survey and after the rush of harvest is over will proceed with  the construction of the canal. It seems that the gentile element have a great amount of confidence ENDENTRY all (in our people, many prominent business men have expressed themselves, that if President Kimball  would take hold of this they would support him with their means and labor. Of course the united action of the Priesthood of God is a mystery to them; we have placed ourselves under the direction of the Lord in this labor as in all others; We acknowledge his hand in, that, the dissention existed in the outsiders and has been placed in the hands of the people.

They arrived in good health and spirits and report having a pleasant passage down.  I found all progressing quite well in the Tuomotu Islands. The most discouraging feature there is the Catholic influence. While I was at Hibuera - Moti one of our men was discharged from the public school service and a catholic put in his place. The Catholic was brought  from another island to take his place. At Hikueru we have 145 while the catholics have 5.

I am owing the Office $121261/100.  About $80000/- of this amount (I don't remember the exact amount, but  Bro.

Then those who have nothing but their hands and are used to working in factories, etc, Can Remain in the Eastern States for the present and obtain their ...un kind of Employment; be- ing Organised, or adopted into branches; where ever they may sojourn; and thus they can subsist and Lay up money which will in time enable them to Settle or be Settled in to the west.  Or factories will be reared there which will afford employ- ment.  till then it is of no use to go west, only for those who have the means to enable themselves.

One  was ^or is^ called the Hall of Columbus, and the other the Hall of Washington; they  will seat perhaps a few more people than  the Salt Lake Assembly Hall, not many more; besides these there are 31 Department  Halls, where meetings convene, Conferences  are held and Committees meet from time  to time.  It was in one of these, Hall 7, -  that we held our meeting.  It would seat  about seven or eight hundred perhaps, but  there were never chairs enough at any time for  the seating capacity; in fact the Art Palace  like the World's Fair is still unfinished. We took the day assigned to us by the  officers of the National Council, it was not the most favorable day, but that was un- avoidable on our part.  The meeting for the   ENDENTRY 4 Palmer House, Chicago. ....................189.. election of officers for the International  Council was held that morning and con- sequently Miss Lucy Stone  May Wright Sarah  Rachel Foster Avery, and others whom we would have liked to be present ^could not come^. Miss  Anthony and Mrs. Avery both expressed  their regrets.  In the evening Mrs. Avery  came in to the meeting for a few minutes. However New Orleans^ and  Dr. illegible L. Gilchrist of Ohio were present.  Mrs. Saxon  spoke well in praise of our people; and I am  sure it will do us good. In the evening Mrs. Mrs. Solomon Thatcher Jun. each spoke a short time in  the Young Ladies Meeting.  Mrs. Young represented the Society  of which she is President in the meeting  or Report Conference ^(5 minutes)^, and she also spoke  five minutes in the discussion of the  subject Woman as a Religions Zaetia. She spoke first in our meeting, made  ENDENTRY 5 Palmer House, Chicago. ...........189... the opening address.  Perhaps you are aware  that the whole proceedings of all meetings held under the auspices of the World's Congress  Auxiliary will be published in the volumes  that are to be prepared later, of the entire  work done during the six months, as you  see we come in for that, and if there  were not so many to hear us, there will  be a great many to read about us, and  the whole matter will be there (officially)  and I don't think any one ^of our people^ will be asham- ed of it when compared with that of  other women's works, and meetings.  There were I believe three Bishops at our meetings  Bishop Geo. Romney and  Robert Morris, and in the evening  Talmage.  One thing that astonished me very much  was the fact that I was appointed to preside  over one of the Congresses, Saturday morning  in the Hall of Columbus.  It was an honor  I could not have expected.  I had received  a hint of it - but the letter bringing the ap- ENDENTRY 6 Palmer House, Chicago. ..............189...... pointment did not reach Salt Lake City  until after Sewall informed me of the fact, it was a great  surprise.  I look upon it as a compliment  to our people, that one of us should have been  asked to fill so conspicuous a place in the  Congress proper.  I feel that the Lord has  blessed us and that the blessings pro- nounced upon our heads by the priesthood  before we left have been fulfilled so far.  I had forgotten to tell you that Sister Zina sat upon the platform on Sunday  with the women ministers of other and  all denominations represented, there, but was not invited to take any  part in the service.  She has been  treated, as indeed we all have with the  greatest respect, and I think the  brethren who were down here will tes- tify to our representation, and to our  trying to sow the good seed.  And in conclusion allow me to congrat- ulate you upon your restoration to health, ENDENTRY 7 Palmer House, Chicago. ................189..... and to wish for you every blessing life  can afford.  I know you must rejoice  that the great and grand and holy  Temple is completed during your ad- ministration, and that you had the  blessed privilege of dedicating it  unto the Lord-; and now that you  also enjoy the sacred right and priv- ilege of going in and out, and ministering  there in the offices of the holy priesthood. For all these great advantages the Latter Day Saints (even the humblest among  them) thank our Heavenly Father, in your  behalf, for no man is more greatly beloved  by his people than President Woodruff.  With kind remembrences to your wife  Geo. Q. Cannon  and Joseph F. Smith, and still desiring  an interest in your faith and prayers,  while we remain here striving to do a  little good in our weak way to those of  our own sex, believe we ever willing and  anxious to work for Zion - Your Sister in the Gospel Emmeline B. Wells Secretary Y.W.R.S.-  ENDENTRY I feel that we should have literature adapted to the child- ren here that will both interest and instruct. At present we have no literature suitable for them; it all being too ad- vanced, and we find it a  even in Sunday School  to interest them. I believe a translation of the Book of Mormon  cards would be an excellent thing  the Book of  Mormon.  Where we have tracts on the first principles of the gos- pel written by some of our most learned and successful preachers I believe in writing tracts for this mission, that  it will be wiser to take them for translation localizing  comparisons than for the elders to spend efforts in com- posing tracts for where we are young and inexperienced I fear that a composition would be inferior to a trans- lation of such tracts. If this melets your approval I  shall be pleased to receive suggestions as to tracts you  most prefer for translation  I believe that it will be wise to translate the "Suc- cession in the Presidency of the Church", "Doctrine and Covenants" and the Book of Mormon in the under mentioned. On view of the fact that the  ENDENTRY among our strongest opponents . That all our contens- ions with them fall almost wholly upon theachings of  the Doctrine and Covenants. I would prefer the book to the  Book of Mormon for this locality. The Catholic are trans- lating or rather mistranslating these books which they propose to publish. We can expect a translation of these works by the Josephites in a few years as the^y^ have   their intention, publicly to this effect. A trans- lation of the Doctrine and Covenants as they have it would be of great disadvantage to us here without our own translated. I believe it will be wise to preach them with these works. I am confident that a translation of  the two ^books^ first mentioned will kill Josephite influence with our people and that they are the books we need to do work a- mong them. The talk of Josephites and Catholics about these books have made the people very anxious for them and if we work wisely we can have the mission here pay  largely toward if not wholly for the publication of the Doctrine and Covenants and Book of Mormon. With your sanction I shall take steps in this direction as fast as  I can. ENDENTRY Salt Lake Dec 1st, 1892 To the presidency  Brethren,  I write you these  few lines in haste. Mr. Gilispie (Secretary of the Choral Society) will call on you this morning  11 a.m. in the interest of the Choral Society, to ascertain if they can render  their oratario "the Light of Asia" in the  large Tabernacle.  The circumstances are as follows.  In the  past the society have had the use of  the building in consideration of their  artistic aims musically.  The chorus  also being too large to appear elsewhere  and being made up of the most  respectable music lovers of both  "Mormon" and "Gentile" a kindly feeling  has been maintained so far.  Last spring there was somewhat of a  falling away owing to various circumstances  not the least of which was the  inability of Tabernacle Choir members  ENDENTRY to attend both organizations. A reorganization was effected this  fall.  Since which time a great interest  has been taken in the beautiful work now to be given.  It was at first thought best not  to ask for the tabernacle and try to  get along with the theatre.  But the  number attending makes it very  inconvenient to do this.  as it will  take about all the proceeds to make  the extra preparations, pay rent, hire  instrumentalists etc. if indeed they can  be crowded on the stage in working  order at all.  Then the capacity of the  building will scarcely justify presenting  such an important musical work there. So they have concluded to return to you  and ask a continuation of past favors  if such a thing is deemed possible  under present circumstances.    ENDENTRY this you can decide.  I only wish  to state in their behalf that they  are as worthy as in the past, struggling  as they are nobly for the advancement  of music in the community, and  honestly carrying everything above  partizan feelings, and in need of  room to render to the public one of  the most chaste, beautiful and clasic  musical works of the present age. I am still their hired conductor, but  have no financial  interest in the  public rendition of the work. Leaving the matter entirely to your  good judgement, I prefer not  comming personally with Mr. Gilispie  to see about the matter.  Your Bro Evan Stephens  If you deem it wise you can show  this to Mr. Gilispie, least he should think  that I may have done something to  oppose in the matter. E Stephens ENDENTRY Sept 21/88. F.D.

Beloved Brothren  I am requested by the Board of  Directors of the Deseret News Company to address you this note  of inquiry.-  Brother Junius f. Wells, Editor of the "Contributor",  has obtained credit of the Deseret News Company for the pub- lication of that work, and has accumulated an indebtedness  therefor amounting to $4,52080, exclusive of the work done during  the first half of the present month.  When urged by our collector to make a payment, he  says:- "In reply, permit me to say that the account up to  Nov. 1, 1887 amounting to $2,600 is in the hands of the General Superintendency of Y. M. M. I. A., from whom I am looking for  advice as to its settlement."  The information we respectfully ask is whether  the General superintendency have assumed, or are likely to  assume, the payment of the $2,600 named by Brother Wells.  I being known to part of the Directors that a sum of  $5,000 has been guaranteed to the Young Men's Mutual Improvement ENDENTRY 2 Association in the interest of their publishing business it is desired  to know if so much of it may be expected to settle that item of account  with the "News," or if it is the intention of the superintendency to pay  it in any other way or is Brother Wells pretending this as subter- fuge in order to excuse delay in the payment of so much of his  account?  If you could favor me with an answer to this before  our meeting on Monday evening next, it would be appreciated.  Yours Most Resspectfully F. D. Richards - ENDENTRY OFFICE OF  Deseret Sunday School Union, NOS. 512 and 513 CONSTITUTION BUILDING, Main Street.  Salt Lake City, Utah, October 29th 1897  To President Woodruff George Q Cannon and Joseph F Smith  Dear Brethren/  In reflecting over the crude and  unsatisfactory way I answered your queries yesterday I have  not felt good about it. I ought to have simply stated, that having  so many years ^enjoyed^ my privileged labors in connexion with thousands of  Sunday School Children and others, and fearing lest the duties of a new  calling might necessitate my resignation from a position so long enjoyed, and  the performance of whose duties, afforded such unalloyed pleasure to myself, and  apparantly to tens of thousands of others, natuarally aroused serious reflections.   I had the impression that the two positions could not be consistently held at the same  time, viz that of a Patriarch, and the one I now hold. The assurances you gave  me yesterday entirely dissipated my erronious idea, and with thankfulness and  gratitude to my Heavenly Father for your kind consideration towards me I accept  your Ordination blessing, and pray that I may fully appreciate and enjoy all the glorious  gifts pronounced upon my head. Any suggestions or instructions you can give me will be very gratefully appreciated by  Your friend and Brother in the Gospel George Goddard.

It will also stop the  rent that we sustain at and considerable food can  be taken from the ground.  While at klikeuru I put this matter before the confer- ence and they responded with $602.50 for this purpose  I wrote to the lower conference of the Tuamotu Islands and they have responded with $5.00 a peice to be paid next October conference. I expect enough to make it up to  $1000.00. This sum will enable us to put up a meeting house of a capacity 30 feet long by 20 feet wide, a presi- dents office and a bed room for elders. each room 12X14 and furnish seats for the meeting house providing we do all our own labors. I can get all of the labor donated The three rooms should be 12 feet to the square. If our work justifies it we may be able to get a house built in the city proper or rent a building to hold classes in.  The saints of Takaroa have spent three days in div- ing to obtain money to finish and about $600000 on hand to complete their building. The mason work ENDENTRY is all done and this amount will put in to a ruff, and furniture etc. They propose plating it with seats from America and to purchase an organ for it. I have not seen the building myself but understand that it is over 100 feet in length. When completed it will be second to no building of its kind in the  south seas. Marakau and Anaa have also obtained means in they same manner. They are looking for Elder Dickerson back to help them. If possible I shall be pleased to have you send an elder who is handy with tools as he will be needed here very much. Takaroa will not be ready to begin  work until after October.

To the President and Counselors of Wasatch Stake:  DEAR BRETHREN:- The Council of the Apostles have had under consideration the subject of the proper remuneration for the Presidents of Stakes and their Counselors. It has been felt for some time that where officers act in such an important position as the Presidency of a Stake, and whose time is much engrossed with public affairs some appropriation should be made to assist them in bearing the pecuniary burdens which rest upon them connected with the sustenance of their families. Among other names which came up before the Council, were yours, and it was decided to allow the President of your Stake Three hundred- Dollars per annum, and each of the Counselors One hundred + fifty- Dollars; these amounts to be paid quarterly, in advance, commencing April 1st, 1888, and to be drawn in the various kinds of tithing received, in equitable proportions. You will have sent you from my office an order to cover those amounts, and they will be remitted to you quarterly, hereafter.  In making these appropriations to you, as the Presidency of the Wasatch Stake, it is expected that you will devote your- selves, to as great an extent as possible, to the duties of your ministry, and that you will look strictly after the welfare of the Saints in your charge.  Difficulties and contentions should not be allowed to grow to any size without receiving speedy attention from you. If brethren are known to be living in an unfriendly and unbrotherly manner, you should instruct the Bishops to see that the Teachers visit these brethren, and by their judicious labors bring about reconciliation and such harmony of feeling as will admit of all the Saints partaking of the Lord's Supper without condemnation.  The necessity of all the Saints dwelling together in unity should be constantly kept before them.  No man or woman should eat the bread and drink of the cup at the Sacrament who entertains hard feelings against any of his or her brethren and sisters.  They should be taught the importance of settling all their difficulties and ENDENTRY removing all causes of, ill-feeling, so that no condemnation will rest upon them for partaking of this holy ordinance unworthily. By paying strict attention to this, the Wards will be kept in a healthy condition, the Spirit of the Lord will flow freely to the people, and the blessings of heaven will be upon them.  Among other duties, the Saints should be carefully taught the principle of paying their tithes strictly and punctually.  They should be impressed with its importance, for their own sakes and for the material advantages which will come to them by a close observance of this holy law. The experience of the Latter-day Saints during the time the law has been taught to us, abundantly demonstrates that all the Lord has said concerning it, and the promises which He has made, are true, and can be confidently relied upon.  Proofs of this are to be foudn in every family and Ward where this law has been observed.  When this was given as a standing law to the Latter-day Saints, to be observed by them forever, we were instructed by the Lord that we were to pay one-tenth of all our interest annually, and that we must observe this law or we should not be found worthy to abide among the Saints. We were further told, "If my people observe not this law to keep it holy, and by this law sanctify the land of Zion unto them, that my statutes and my judgments may be kept thereon, that it may be most holy, behold, verily I say unto you, it shall not be a land of Zion unto you."  It is a law, which, if properly observed, will prepare the Church of Christ against the day of vengeance and burning which will come upon the ungodly.  Too great importance, there- fore, cannot be attached to its correct observance.   The Lord, through His prophet Malachi, commanded ancient Israel to bring "all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house,and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts.  And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts." These words are as true now and as applicable to us as they were then, and compliance with these requirements will be attended with the same blessings; for God does not change, and those who keep His commandments to-day, we are assured, will receive His blessings as freely as they have done at any other period.  Our tithing, or, as it is sometimes called, voluntary donations, should increase as the growth of the people in numbers and in property increases.  It is not creditable to any Stake to  ENDENTRY have tithing fall off, unless the season and business of the year should be very unfavorable. Under ordinary circumstances, with ordinary prosperity, there should be a gain each year.  When there is not, there is room to fear that there is decline in the faith or interest of the Saints in the performance of this duty.  Respecting the percentage which was authorized by the late President John Taylor, in his capacity as Trustee-in-Trust, as compensation to the Bishops and Clerks in the Wards and Stakes, the Council have decided that this shall hereafter be distributed by the Presidency and the High Council of each Stake, and according to the amount and value of the services rendered by the Bishops and Clerks of the Wards, and to the Bishop's Agent or Stake Clerk.  You will, there- fore, please consider this hereafter as a part of your duties, in connection with the High Council of your Stake, and we trust that you will be able to give such satisfaction in the equitable distribu- tion of this that there will be no complaints.  Praying the Lord to fill you with the spirit and power necessary to enable you to dis- charge all the duties of your high calling in righteousness before Him,  I remain, with kind regards, your brother,  Wilford Woodruff  In behalf of the Council of the Apostles.
