Nauvoo Sept 23rd 1844.  Beloved Bro. Wilford Woodruff:-  I embrace the present opportunity of writing  a few lines to inform you that I received your epistle of the 8th  inst and its contents duly examined, therefore, I would say to you  in the first place that every thing is going on well here at the present  and the Temple is going on rapidly and with greater rapidity than  it has since the commencement, and the brethren are rejoicing in the  fulness of the Gospel of the Son of Man, and every thing seems to all  appearance to roll on and turn round for the well-being, happiness, and prosperity of the Saints of Almighty God; praying that the  God who rules the Armies of Israel, and sits enthroned in the  heavens will hear our prayers in your behalf that you may be sus- -tained and upheld by the faith and prayer of the Saints that you  may be unabled to fulfil your important mission which devolves  upon you with fidelity that the great work of our God may roll  forth in mighty power through your instrumentallity and the  kingdom of God be established never more to be thrown down  and when he whose right it is to reign should reign King of Nations as  he does King of Saints  There has been a great deal happened here since you left this  place and as you will see all the particulars by perusing the Neighbor  and times and Seasons where you will find that Elder Rigdon along with  some others have been tried and cut off from the church by the unanimous  voice of the same, shortly after he came here he began to work secretly and privately  and underhandedly for to destroy the church if possibly, and it has come out  ENDENTRY that he has said that Joseph was a fallen prophet and that he had not  been led by the Lord for a long time, ^or to that amount^ and also that he (Sidney) had in his  possession documents whereby he could have destroyed Brother Joseph  long ago if he had - had a mind to do so  As to your question concerning the $500 dollars it is to be paid out  of the Temple money at Liverpool and not any of it out of the Book Mon- -ey, emigration money or printing money, but let Bro Jones have  money from time to time as it comes into your hands by tithing, the  $50 dollars which I gave Bro Jones has to come out of the $500 dollars  as I understand  As to the twenty five Pounds that the letter speaks of is the money  that Mc  Niel has to draw from the office in Liverpool by Mr Jeff- -reys, you have $52 dollars and 25 cents of it that Bishop Whitney  handed you, this amount you must pay out of the emigration money, the remainder of the 25 Pounds is to come out of the Temple money.  The order that I gave you on Handen Harnden and Coy  forwarding Agents, No 3 Wall Street, New York, is for your own benefit  the remainder if there is any, there ^it^ will be sent to me on my  order.  See if you can render brother Jones any assistance on your  way to Liverpool I would like you to do so.  With regard to your questions regarding the apostates  I would say to you to warn the Saints in the East and else- where in the regions round about to have nothing to do with  such characters and to have no dealings with any of these  men. ENDENTRY Bro Woodruff with regard to the business you know what  to do, do just as we talked of and obtain ^as many (copy^ rights) ^as you can^ for the  printing of books, such as Hymn Books and other books  which will be necessary  Book of Doctrin and Covenants and byen history  of Mc church Brigham Young To Wilford Woodruff Esq ENDENTRY numbers written by WW  25  stamp in red ink illegible SEP.  28 Mo.

Decr 3, 1844  Dear Brother:  Having a few moments of lesson I now are proove the, for the purpose of conferring a little with you ou we can- not have an oppertunity of chatting together, we must use this sirtize- cial means. Allow me in the first place to congratulate you upon  your safe arrival in England with your family where I hope that you and your enjoy all the happeness and comfort that your circum- stances will admit of but as your heart is in Zion I must hasten to give you some information in relation to the situation of things in this place.  The Temple has progressed very much since your departure the capitals are now all on and present a splendid appearance. I  think that I informed you in my last of the movements of the Governor when here, and the papers will inform you that nine persons were mocked ^by the Grand Jury (none of whom were mormons)^ for the murder of Generals Hy- rum Smith; among whom is Thomas Sharp, Editor of the Warsaw signal Senator Davis, our representative in the Sente, and Colonol Williams, of mobocratie momory. The sheriff has catsly made an attempt to take some of those men; but has not succeded. I expeting shurely how prone to springfield to arrest Davis having been informed that he has gone there, should this be the case he may probably find an in- convenient change, from the senate of Illinois to apartments in  the jail. Mobbnary seems to be at an end for the present and all is peace.  Nauvoo begins agian to reason its former appearances a great many new houses how join up this fall, transfacturing establishments are about being commend of various friends, we expect a cotton factory to start in the spring and every- thing qoumes a lively, and prosperous aspect.  Jent E. Twin I commenced this some few circumstances have occured that cause things in the sigistature to wear ENDENTRY a different aspect. The Senate have hopped a bill repeal- ing the whole of the Nauvoo Charters; but it has pof- sed the House of Representatives and we posum it also we The Govenor has written a special message to the Lepesla- ture on the subject of mormon affairs giving a pretty pair reoresintation, this I am told, had great unflunce on their mind which had been poisoned by our enimies. our representative in the senate being one that was indic ted for the murder of Hyrum Smith, of course we could expect nothing from that source, and so long have an been accustomed to be tradived injured and oppressed that we were suprised to hear anything like truth from the power nor by the by, what would the english government things of two leading men in and counting one of whom was a cani- didate for the presidency being murdered in jail, and the murder's who have been indicted still running at hope and the Senate not only countenancing the murder; but screening a murderer, one of Neils own members from  justice?  The seventies hall has lately been completed and it has been dedicated two Quorums with their families friends met in it each day and as then are now fifteen quorums organized it took some time to get through they even addressed very frequently by the Twelve.

I must now come to hearings matters, how to over count for it I dont know perhaps you can; but al- though we receive regularly from Glasgow, Liverpool papers that are sent to us, we have not for twelve or eighteen months received one solitary member of the "star". I hope now that you have got Charge your stars will shine even to Nauvoo.  I shall feel obliged by you taking charge of all my basenys affiars and letting me know how they started I feel course to  finding fault; that vally there does seem to me to page torn something out of joint for although I have sent papers to the amount of 13 hundred dollars, then has only been twenty ^dollars^ sent to me, and that was hand out before I got it. I believe I got few dollars before that $400 dollars of this was what was due before we dessolve part- nership. I expected money last spring, and particularly last fall, but have not received one cent nor have I ever even received a letter acknowledging their receipt. I told my clerk Joseph Cain to write to Br. Mancaster in the sole of Man to forward me two watches one for Elias Smith and the other for myself and to take his pay in books, or an order on Br. Hedlock, Br. Muncaster has written here stating that he had seen Br Hedlock who told him that he had better not make them untill he heard againfrom here. I never made Br Hedlock my guardian. I was not aware but that I could do my own business and know what I wanted myself till then, perhaps he can explain. Br. Geilding was to have sent me some money last spring, but I have not even heard from him. I am not in the habit of treating other people as above mentioned and I dont like to be healed so myself. Your may shew this to the parties concerned, if you think proper. ENDENTRY Now dear Br. you may think that I have been somewhat sever in the above remarks; but I think not without occa sion You have something of my circumstances I have been very much troubled to meet my payments ever since I took the place. In my last office at Carthege with one thing or other I have lost 3 or 4 hundred dollars. And I have never had money to get stock from the office I have had to borrow money  the pay it in property, or any way I could. I have now borrow ed money near six hundred dollars to keep things going if I dont get some in the spring I dont know what I shall do I of course have no chains upon you, but mention these things for your information and if you can do anything towards regulating these matters and me in the spring you will couper a favor upon me that I shall at all times be most happy to reaposacte.

Provo City, Utah, September 22, 1888 President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother, Your favor of Sept. 12. did come to hand at the proper time, but it was not possible for me to answer any sooner, as I shall endeavor to explain in this report.  In conformity with your telegram of yesterday week ago,  I instructed Bro. Savage to start at once to St. George, where he, no doubtt, is engaged now in arranging matters for opening  of that Stake Academy.  Bro. Vaner had unfortunately made arrangements with  the Trustees at Oakcreek, unknown to me, that if he should  not be called to the Sandwich Islands, he would teach  their school this winter.  He is yet attending the Academy, finishing his Normal Course, but intends going to Oak= creek at Conference.  I told him that I did not approve this step having been taken without my knowledge, but  that he must keep his word now with those Trustees.  In regard to the appointment of Bro. Alma Greenwood  for Joshua to succeed him at Fillmore, enclosed communications  will explain the situation of affairs at Fillmore.  I have   ENDENTRY numbered the letters in the order in which I have received them, and then you will be able to give your instructions to the re= spective parties in view of the prevailing facts.  I shall  write to President Hinckley and to the Bros. Greenwood that  the case has been referred to you for decision.  Bro Spori has written to me that he intends taking up  some district school to teach, and prefers, therefore, to attend  Logan College for the present.  I have now no one else anymore to propose, neither  for Coalville, and, as enclosed  letter from Paris explains, for that latter place neither.  The starting of an Academy in a new place, upon our  plan of Gospel education is so important a step, that any  failure of success will retard the work in that part of the  country for years.  Hence my reluctance in letting Bro. Cornwall take hold of the work in Franchlin, as in some  points he is yet quite deficient; but as he has the spirit of  the Latterday Work in his heart, God may assist him greatly  in overcoming his deficiencies.  I shall answer the Bear Lake authorities also that I had submitted their applic= ation to you.  They had written to Bro. Benj. Cluff, now  at Ann Arbor, to take charge of their Academy, but Bro. Cluff had made up his mind long ago to stay at that  University at least until next spring, and longer if he  can raise the means.  Bro. Box Elder Stake Academy, ENDENTRY BOARD OF TRUSTEES.

Dear Brother,  Your favors of Aug. 30, 31, and Sept. 5, have been duly received. In regard to the first of these, my letter containing the letter of Bro. Spori applying for the position of Principal of the Rexburg, would have served as answer. I received your letter after mine to had been mailed to you already. Bro. Spori's Certificates, both in regard to his examinations, as well as to his services as prac- ticed teacher, obtained from Swiss School authorities, are of the highest order. I shall forward him his papers again today, with my suggestion in regard to Provo, but with your pater- nal solicitation concerning his private affairs. Leaving it at his option to go to Logan, if that is the best he can do. But if the Authorities of Bannock Stake should want their Prin- cipal soon, we should have to find another one install after all. Please to instruct me on this point.  Your letter of the 31. of Aug. reached me Wednesday, Sept. 5. two days after the opening of the S. Lake S. Academy, I could, therefore, not avail myself anymore of your kind invitation. In regard to St. George's Academy, I am somewhat puzzled; for after the receipt of Bro. Blake's letter, which I have ENDENTRY mailed to you, in which it was stated that Bro. Nephi Savage had not been heard from, the latter submitted to me yesterday on the occasion of his farewell visit, quite a correspondence with the Authorities at St.  George, the last a lengthy official communication from the Secretary of the Board, dated Sept. 1. containing the final points of agreement, all of which Bro. Savage has accepted and written them to that effect.  He was ready to start for St. George as soon the telegram would come to tell him, that his letter had been received,  and they were ready to receive him.  Your favor of Sept. t., received this morning, fills me with ^as^ much joy and satisfaction on the one hand, as it causes me concern and anxiety on the other.  When I received your instructions after the last meeting of the General Board to the effect, that in consid ,, eration of prevailing circumstances no more Academics were to be started for the present, except the Brigham City, I advised all available teachers not to wait any longer, but make their arrangements for the coming schoolyear.  This they have done,  and we are now somewhat in straits to supply the unexpec,, ted demands in a satisfactory manner.  It has been my aim and will remain my aim, until otherwise instructed by you to have all these Academics work harmoniously working so that a well defined system of education for the youth of  Zion under the direction of the General Board may gradually be developed, which can be done most effectually, I believe,  if all these principals fully realize, that they are construc,, ting parts of one system under the direction of the General ENDENTRY Sep8 1888 BOARD OF TRUSTEES.

The general plan and organization of the B. Y. Academy has thus far been taken as the common stand,, ard, and it requires therefore, a certain personal familiarity of the respective principal with this standard, in order to facilitate the work.  The future development of Zion's educational system will go far beyond what the B. Y. A.  is or ever can be, but it was fortunate that a common  starting point has been decided upon.  The new Academy at Coalville must be supplied with an efficient principal, and if I should propose someone who had to be taken away from some other appointment.  As a first trial of this sort,  I venture to suggest to you Bro. Angus Vance, whose I name I suggested to you as teacher for the Sandwich Islands, but as I received no answer from you in regard to that suggestion, I  suppose, that you have disposed of that case in some other way.  Bro. A. Vance would accept any reasonably moderate salary for a beginning, until I ^he^ can show what he can do, when ENDENTRY for the interest of the institution itself his salary ought to be raised correspondingly.  A certain grading of all these schools would be advisable, in order to give efficient teachers an op,, portunity to be placed by and by into such positions where they can do the most good.  When Bro. Greenwood was here the last time, the very point of feeling on the past of the Board at Fillmore in case of his resignation and removal came up, and he assured me that the bretheren there understood the situation, and could not blame him after for trying to better himself, after he stood by them so long.  I should propose in case of your approval of Bro. Greenwood's appointment for Sanpet Stake Academy, that his brother Joshua, who has placed himself also at the disposal of the General Board, and who has been assisting Alma in that Academy, and also been teaching the district schools at Fillmore, takes hold of that Academy for a year, and then you can decide on the future course.  "With deep regret I have learned of the death of Bro. Horace S. Eldredge, member of the General Board of Education, and may God inspire you to find a man to fill his place in that position as efficient as Bro. Eldredge has done.

Dear Brother, Enclosed please find draft for Circular, as you instruc= ted me to get it up, and also drafts for financial and  statistical schedules.  The eleven points of instruction have been presen= ting themselves to my mind for a long time as es= sential for the establishment of a systematic church= school organization.  I have not been so painstaking  in regard to the form of expression, as I have been  concerning the ideas themselves, and Bro. Reynolds,  having more esperience in such work, can remodel them to your satisfaction.  I have succeeded after much trouble of obtaining  the services of Bro. Josiah Hickman, student of the  Normal Postgradduating Class in this Academy, to  fill the place of Bro. Fillmore, and have telegraphed Bro. Hinckley to that effect.  Bro. Hickman is a married man, and has been practical  teacher for three years, giving great satisfaction.  He is  a faithful Latterday Saint, and will start for  ENDENTRY Fillmore at the beginning of next week, to commence teach- ing Monday, Nov. 22.  My letter of today to Bro. Hinckley will  give further particulars.  We had a lengthy conversation  with Bro. Greenwood last night, and got posted about the  status of the Millard Stake Academy.  I introduced during Conference Bro. Joseph Nelson to Pres. W. W. Cluff, after I had a conversation with him in regard  to the matter.  Proposing that Bro. Nelson was to start the Prepara= tory and Intermediate Grade during this schoolyear, and then  for next schoolyear we would furnish them a Principal  who would be able to organize an academic depart= ment.  This was exactly the course which we had so  successfully pursued, only for a much longer period, at the Salt Lake Stake Academy.  Bro. W. W. Cluff  told Bro. Nelson, he would send him the decision of his  Board by the end of this week.  If some of these Boards  will not meet us half ways just now, until we  have first class teachers at our disposal next summer, our way will be much more difficult than it would  be necessary.  Bro. Spori is spending this week with me again  in Provo, taking notes etc.  I have also furnished him  one of my Normals, Bro. Axle Nielson, a very  good young man, as Assistant, who will attend  particularly to the Language Part of teaching.  Bro.

Nielsen at Conference, and prom= ised him $20000 and Board for the first academic year. He will accompany Bro. Idaho next Saturday.  Prof. Hanish, I am informed, has left for the  East again discouraged and in a sullen spirit.  I requested  Bro. Spence to inquire of the authorities at Bear Lake,  if they still desired me to furnish them a Principal, as I have one ready for them, viz. Bro. Jedediah Taylor, also one of my Postgraduating Class, a married man, and a good Latterday Saint, who is perfectly capable  to conduct the Intermediate Grade, until their Academy  will be sufficiently advanced next year or some  future time, to organize a scientific department,  when we will find some Professor for them.  Pres. Shurtliff told me, that they had organized  at Monch to be their Prin= cipal.  I arranged with Bro. Shurtliff that Bro. Monch,  after his return, should spend a few days with me in  Provo, in order to become familiar with our system.  I am just informed, that Bro. Hickman needs  also an Assistant, as Bro Greenwood is taking  ENDENTRY his along with him to Sanpete.  I have to see, therefore,  where to find one for him, that is versed somewhat in  Music, in order to conduct the singing.  There is a churchschool in operation at Sprin= ville conducted by Bro. Simon Eggerton.  They have  a regularly organized Board, which, of course, could  properly act only under the direction of the Stake  Board.  But there is no Stake Board organized yet  here, although I have urged upon the bretheren  to do so, and fill out the vacancies in the B. Y. Academy Board in this manner.  The members of the B. Y. Academy  Board, could continue to act in their capacity as Trustees, as far the estate is concerned belonging now  to this Academy by endowment from President Young. I think, that these bretheren need some instruction  in this regard from you.  May God bless you is the prayer of  Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser.  P.S.

I have been to Bedford spent three  weeks there with the ENDENTRY saints in that place and the  vicinity around. The work of the  most high has spread fast won- derfully in that region under the  superintendency of Elder Adams I baptized nine in one evening in  the city of Bedford while I was  there Elder Adams supplied my place  in London and with the assistance  of our Lord accomplished much  good in extending the borders of  Zion. Being at Woolwich  a short time since I administered  baptism in the river Thames  oft happened precisely at the place  where Elder Kimball a beloved  name at woolwich by the by About  eight months previously had attem^pted^  to adinister the ordinance but was prevented by the great  quantities of Ice which at that  time flooded this beautiful  river. Consequently there being no suitable place  nearer he came to London ENDENTRY the distance of eight miles and made use of a private  bath I think I never admin^istered^  baptism under circumstances more interesting. It was a  most beautiful evening.  Having selected a late hour we  were therefore enabled to proceed in the performance of our Lords commandments unobserved and unmolested by the thousands of human beings that in the  hours of business are constantly  passing and repassing ^the place^ we then  were occupying All nature seem'd hushed in silence Heaven's broad archway was radiating from every point her Starry  beams upon the still scenery around  a little  distance unconsious of the  glorious work we were accom- plishing were thousands and thou- sands of human beings wrapped  in midnight slumbers and whose  minds also were Deeply wound  round with^in^ Dark folds with  sectarian follies and vain  ENDENTRY traditions. Before us were  multitudes of vessels resting peacefully upon the broad bosoms of this delightful river We knelt upon the bank  and the Stillness of the scene  was now broken by the voice of supplications. The Saints in some parts of England are not without the share of  persecutions In Cheltenham especially the spirit of mobocracy  has become considerably manifest Brother Candling was there a  short time since ^and^ gives a fine  specimen of the love the people of that country cherish  toward the saints of the Most  High. Brother C. is a young man of very promising abilities.  Strong in faith, sound mind  precedent, wise, energetic, and  perservering One evening while  engaged in preaching a mob  of some  young men ENDENTRY Drove into the room and without ceremony showered Down upon him a very heavy  volly of rotten eggs; not being  satisfied they then blew out  the lights and left the saints shrowded in the midst of  night. the candles being  lighted the mob soon after  once more made their  appearance Brother Candland then spoke the them by the power of the spirit informed them  that not a single one who had been engaged in the riot should  live to experience the full age of manhood Being struck with astonishment and probably with  fear also at the bold and fearless manner in which this prophetic  statment was made they quietly  took their seats and earnestly  requested Brother C - to continue his preaching accordingly he did so  and with advantage effectually  melting ^Down^ the hearts of the mob ENDENTRY so much so that afterwards he received  from them the best treatment he  could have wished. Many of the servan^ts^ of God however who have been labour- ing in that vicinity have far less proved fortunate mobs sometimes  throng'd their preaching rooms and  prevented preaching, and abus'd the  saints shamefully may the Lord  God of Zion mete out to them all  their appropriate rewards. The Saints  in London have made very good pro- gress upon the holy path of faith, wis- dom, knowledge, gifts and graces belong- ing to the kingdom so much so that  when visited by sickness they now cheerfully and I may say almost  rally instead of sending for Physicians  call upon the servants of God according to the rules prescribed by James. You know the circumstances that seem to  opperate in this city more than in any  other against making so rapid impro- vement in spiritual things there is  so much vanity, wickedness, abomina- tions of every kind imaginable arising from every quarter that the saints find themselves beset on every hand with dangerous temptations and ENDENTRY unless they are mindful they find themselves before they are aware of it  under the influence of false spirits  Generally speaking the minds of the  people in the city are more deeply  shrowded in darkness than any place I was ever in before.

You show a large increase in  your early emigration. I was glad to hear of your good  health and the progress of the work in your field of labor. The work is also prospering in rather a wonderful manner in our  Southern States, under the presidency of Brother John Morgan. I have had several interesting letters from him of late, in one of which he says, "During the forty days since I left Salt Lake, I have travelled 4852 miles, passing through nine  states and three territories, witnessed 50 baptisms, blessed nine children, and administered to nine sick." In his  last letter he says they baptized 50 in the month of April,  and that the work is increasing in the Southern country. The speeches of several southern members in the Senate, against the Edmunds bill, and in favor of Geo. Q. Cannon taking  his seat, have been published in pamphlet form and have had a good effect in the South. There have been far  more calls there for preaching than before. Brother Morgan has called for ten more missionaries now, and he wants twenty more by the first of September. The terrible raging of ENDENTRY the devil and the priests of the land is calling the attention of the whole nation to the subject of Mormonism. The Lord will overrule all things for the good of the Saints, and his work will roll on unto the end. Geo. Q. Cannon, in his last letter to me, said, "I have just had an interview with hHouse, and he said he was ashamed to look me in the face, for he had done the most cow- ardly thing, in not speaking in my favor, that he ever was guilty of in his life. There are a number of representatives who feel the same. An ex-governor made about the same remarks to me a few days ago, and told a number of the mem- bers that was his feeling. Judge Pennsylvania, the father of the House, being the oldest man there, feels the same." The first member he speaks of had several  points written, in favor of Cannon, to speak upon, but Keifer, the speaker, cracked the party whip so loud that they  had to wheel into line. What a terrible state our nation is in, to trample underfoot all constitutional law and deprive men of  all rights and privileges, because public clamor and party spirit require it. When a nation stands upon such ground, it stands upon a volcano, that will soon open and swallow it up. The mob, and not law, now rules Congress. The best jurists in America, such as Black and others, say that the Edmunds bill is entirely ENDENTRY unconstitutional, and, if any point under it could be brought before the Supreme Court of the United States, it would be condemned, if the judges had independence of mind to judge constitutionally. Constitution or no constitution, law or no law, I shall vote against Cannon." This is the state of our nation today, and wo be unto it, for it is preparing to take the same road as did the Jaredites and Nephites. A certain communication given to us two years ago is now being fulfilled to the very letter. All is peace as yet with us, no  excitement with the priesthood. We try to express ourselves in wisdom, but plainly. We had a good Conference at Logan  last Saturday and Sunday. The Temple is progressing rap- idly, there. We expect to finish the working portion of it the  present season. We have expended already upon it $388,068.11. The population of that stake is 15,938 souls, 5,036 children under eight years of age. On the 20 and 21st we expect to meet with the Manti Conference. Brother Folsom ex- pects to get that Temple up to the square this season, but we expect that it will take at least two years more to get Salt  Lake Temple up to the square. We call it a general time of health with us. We have some sickness. We buried Jacob Gibson a short time since. Mary Ann Young are very low. Dr. F. D. Benedict died rather suddenly ENDENTRY last night, said to be of pneumonia, but I think bad whisky  had something to do with it. Brother Rich is rather fail- ing, no prospect of being any better. We have had a very  cold backward spring, but for two or three days we have had  very warm weather, 83° to 85° F. in the shade to-day. Our  apple trees are now in bloom. The people of the world are quite astonished at the calmness and composure of the  "Mormons" with such a terrible storm ready to burst over their heads. But the voice of all Israel is, God reigns, and will reign until he puts all enemies under his feet. Remember me kindly to all the Elders with you. I am glad to hear from you at any time.

Elder A. F. McDonald.  Dear Brother—Your letter of March 5, also Brother Harris's letter of same date, arrived yesterday, which I have carefully read and have taken them over to be read to the President, Bro. Taylor. In reply to your letter I would say that I am pleased that you have been able to get some brethren so readily to go with Brother Harris. With regard to Brother Harris's financial ability, I am not much acquainted with it. I expect you will have to give him some counsel with regard to his temporal arrangements in settling with the Mohaves. I think that mission comes under your jurisdiction. I received a letter that Sister Harris wrote to Brother Harris, stating that she and her children  were sick and entirely destitute of food and clothing, and I think they are at Escalante, Garfield County, Utah, in Panguitch Stake. Of course his wife will need some help, but it seems to me that she and her family should be settled with him. The brethren should be counseled, in settling with the Lamanites, to  labor to benefit them, and not to speculate out of them.  Of course these missionaries will have to live, as well as the others. Now concerning Brother Jones, Brother Thatcher was present and heard your letter read, and ENDENTRY he said that when he and Brother Snow were there they had his case up and investigated it, and he agreed to do better. Now if he does not, Brother Thatcher says you have a High Caouncil organized there and can bring him up before it and try him, and if he does not repent and cease to  do evil and injury among the Lamanites, cut him  off from the Church, and take away his priesthood and authority from him, that he shall not have power to  do evil in the name of the Church with either Israel or the Gentiles. I should attend to this, if he will not be subject to counsel. No one is so large in the Kingdom of God but that he must be subject to the  priesthood and the Kingdom of God. I have no special  news to communicate today. We are all well as usual.  We have very pleasant spring weather. People are begin- ning to sow wheat and early garden seeds. Remember me to your family and all enquiring friends. I am  always glad to hear from you. Your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Oct. 19, 1882.  Mr. A. F. McDonald.  Dear Brother—I have received  several letters from you and Brother B. F. Johnson upon the subject of your  settlement in Arizona. These letters have been laid before Presi- dent Taylor and council, and Presi- dent Taylor has expressed himself that he would ^as desirous of^ writeing to both of you and give  some counsel upon the subject. Now  I will say that Brother Johnson had permission, at his own request, to take that journey to look out a location to settle his own family upon, and was counselled to form that settle- ment in some part of Mexico, if  possible. He was not sent to ENDENTRY make a large purchase of land in  Arizona, or anywhere else, with the expectation that the Presidency or the  Twelve would send from one to ten  thousand people to go there and pay  for the land and occupy it. He  was permitted to go to obtain a place  for himself and family in some  part of Old Mexico, but not to engage  a large quantity of land for the  authorities of the Church to pay for.  I do not think the course he has  persued in this matter is satisfac- tory to the authorities of the Church,  and I expected it was for his family  that was in this part of the country.  I did not expect that he would call those who were settled in St. John, for they were sent there to strengthen  that place, and are needed there  quite as much as at Salt River. ENDENTRY I expect that I myself am rather at fault, in his letter of recommenda- tion, in saying that he was called by the Presidency and the Twelve.  I should have said that he had  permission of the Presidency and the  Twelve to go, according to his own  request.  I expect that there  will be some measures taken by the  authorities of the Church to get some  foothold in some part of Mexico.  I see you have taken some steps  yourself to that end.  We have  had a very interesting and busy Conference.  We have filled the  Quorum of the Twelve by ordaining  Heber J. Grant  as aspostles into that quorum, and  Seymour  B. Young to fill the vacancies  in the first Presidency of the Seven- ties.  ENDENTRY I have visited Ashley's Fork with Abram  Hatch, and was gone nineteen days.  I wish to write some to Brother Johnson, which please to deliver to him.  It is a general time  of health with us. I have suffer- ed for two weeks with a cold in  my head, but am getting better  Brother C. C. Rich attended Con- ference a part of one day, but  is still quite feeble. We  anointed him last night and  blessed him. He is something better than he was, but there is  not much hope of his recovering.  He will return to Bear Lake in a few days.  I hope you will succeed in getting an opening in some part of Mexico. Remember me to my enquiring friends.  Your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff.  ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Feby. 21, 1883.

Can you raise them from tithing in your stake? If so, send me the amount and I will endeavor to get a T. T. order for the same. I would like you to get, say,  two families, if you can, in some part of that country, to go with Brother Harris to settle with them, to teach them the Gospel and to farm, and their children to read and write, etc. I would like to have you write to me upon this subject.

Johnson to go with his family to settle in Southern Mexico, under your presidency.  But it is the wish of the First Presidency and the Twelve that he form his settlement, if possible, within the boundaries of old Mexico. This is very desirable to us as a people, and we would ^far^ prefer this to his staying in Arizona with the intention of strengthen- ing the settlements in that Territory. Our faith and prayers are that the Lord will open the way for us to form a nucleus for a gathering place in some part of that republic.  Your brother in the Gospel of Christ.  W. Woodruff.

A. M. Tenney.  Dear Brother.  On my return from a mission to Ashley's Fork of about twenty days, among a package of letters, I found yours of Aug. 28, and I take the first opportunity of answering it. I am glad to hear that the people are doing well at St. Johns. As to our sending more men there, I think it would be a difficult matter. We have had a hard time to send  what we have there. In fact, we  have a call for ten men to sup- ply new settlements, where we find  one to go. I think the Berry boys ENDENTRY are mistaken about Br. Taylor's re- leasing them from St. John's to go where they please, for they were called especially to go to St. Johns. I think all of the brothers should  stick to the work and mission that  they are called to perform.  The Bro's. Johnson were sent to try quietly to get a foot-hold in some part of Mexico; to settle themselves and famalies which might open the way for others to follow. Instead of that they have gone in the mid- st of rail roads and I think in Ari- zona near Salt River and engaged a large quantity of land for some $6,000 or $8,000 and expect us to send men to settle the land and pay ENDENTRY for it. We did not send them on any such errand, and we want you and all the saints in St. Johns to remain and build up that place, instead of going to them. I am still of the opinion that you should still  turn your attention to the Lamanites  of Arizona to benefit those with whom you are acquainted. I am satisfied that you can do more good there than any where else. As to Br. Ira Hatch, I think he was sent to Savoy, to strengthen the place. We are not satisfied to give up the mission among the Lamanites, and I want you to do what you can in that quarter.  I am very busy and cannot write any more at present. Remember me kindly to you family, Br. O'dall, and  enquiring friends.  Your Brother in the Gospel,  W Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Aug. 3rd, 1882.  A. M. Tenney.  Dear Brother:  I received your letter  of July 12th, and have taken the first leisure hour to  answer. I felt very sorry to hear of the St. John difficulty.  When I first heard it, I thought it was you that  was killed. Then I thought it was Warren M. Tenney,  and it was days before I could understand that it  was your father. It was a very serious affair. I knew  the Greer boys or some of them. One of Greer's sons was  in the church and a good Latter Day Saint. I do not  think he was one of the company in that affair. I should  hope not. I hardly thought any of them would turn cow- boys to interfere with the Mexicans without provocation. As  there had been several accounts published upon the sub- ject, I published that portion of your letter relating to  that subject. I felt sorry that your father should have  ended his life in that way.  Now concerning your rail road business. I am glad  you have got through with it, and that you have been ENDENTRY enabled to pay your debts and maintain your honor.  And now, Br. Tenney, I must tell you my thoughts,  and they are these. How much better it would have  been for Br. Ammon to have taken the counsel of the  apostles and leaders of the church and gone among  the Lamanites and taken the lead of that mission  and brought salvation to that branch of the house of  Israel. You would have gained everlasting honors.  That would have been more worth to you than the  whole rail road in Taylor is urging  us to revive that mission among the Lamanites of Ari- zona and New Mexico and we hardly know whom  to call upon to lead in the matter, but we are obliged  to do something. The Indians that we visited feel  to reproach us. They feel that we have deserted them,  and they feel about right too, and we shall be  under condemnation if we do not take steps to  give them the gospel. We have got to do it, and not  only baptize them, but continue to instruct them in  the things of the kingdom of God. Many of the Laman- ites in Utah are calling for baptism and we are  baptising them. The work should go on around  you. Where is mother, ENDENTRY him to many places, but  we have never been enabled to hear from him yet.  We buried Alexander  Pyper, and Father Free of late. John Pack is still  very sick.  If you can do anything in the Indian mis- sion, or know of any one who can, I wish you would  notify me by letter. Give my kind regards to your  family, to Bishop Udall and all enquiring friends.  Your Brother in the Gospel,  W. Woodruff.  ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, June 2, 1882.  Andrew S. Gibbons.  Dear Brother – Your letter of May 16  is before me. In reply I would say that  I have felt grieved in spirit to think that  the Indian mission has been treated in the  way it has. We cannot abandon the In- dian mission upon any account what- ever. I was sorry that Bro. Tenney aban- doned the Indian Mission to work on the  railroad. President Taylor told us to go to  work and reorganize that mission. We  did so in part and appointed James G.  Bleak, of St. George, to preside over the mission.   But President Taylor has not yet given  his consent to the appointment, Brother  Bleak having charge of all the tithing  department of St. George Stake. But  if he is not appointed to that position,  some one else will be. We do not want  to release any Indian missionary  appointed among that tribe. That  ENDENTRY mission should be carried on, and I want  to have Hatch and all  who can talk the Indian language, to  spend all the time they can upon that  mission. I wish Brother Tuba could  spend some time in speaking to his  tribe. There are many thousands  of the Lamanites now looking to us  for salvation through the Gospel, and  we shall not be justified if we do not  impart it to them.  I should be  glad to hear from you at any time.  Remember me kindly to your family,  Bishop Udall, Miles Romney, and  all inquiring friends.  Your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff.  ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Feby. 16, 1883.  Elder Arza E. Hinckley.  Dear Brother—We have received your letter of Jan. 15, and from the report which you make we would recommend that Brother Mojaves, and that he commence farming operations on the  upper land, that is, on the land you say the chief occupies. I have forwarded a Book of Mormon for the chief, but preferred to forward it to you at Mesa, as, if directed to him, he might not obtain it. We are willing that Brother Harris should select one or two families to assist him in his  labors with the Mojaves, the selection to be  made with the consent and under the direc- tion of the Stake president where those families reside. This letter has been submitted to President Taylor, who sanctions this counsel. I sent you a letter and the Book of Mormon Feby. 5. I think, by beginning with the Mojaves, we may reach the Wallapais. I would like you to write to Brother Harris ENDENTRY to go and commence with them as early in the spring as possible, so as to help them get in their crops. I think Brother McDonald would better be  consulted upon the subject and pick out say two families, who would work with Brother Harris in that field of labor. I  will direct this letter in his care. I think it would be well for you to look up a part- ner who is already in that country to go  with you, as I think is is better for two to go together than for one to go alone. I do not know anything about E. Hanks, where  he is, or whether he would be willing to take such a mission. Brother Van Cott was still alive last night, but his friends  are expecting every hour to be his last. John Pack is quite low, but talks a good deal. Please keep me advised of what you are doing. My love to any friends with you. Your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Feby. 21, 1883.  Elder Arza ^E.^ Hinckley.  Dear Brother—Your letter of  Feby. 12 is just received. In reply  I will say that I have written to  Brother McDonald to see if he can  look up two families any where in  Arizona who will go with Brother Harris, and also to furnish him  with a team, wagon, harrow, and  plough out of the tithing of that  country, and send me the amount, and the Trustee in Trust, I think,  will send an order for the same. I will write a page to Brother  Harris and a few words to  Merriman. I have stated to  Brother McDonald that Bro. Bringhurst,  ENDENTRY and Harrison Burgess are all buried. Remember me to all enquiring friends.  Your brother in the Gospel,  W. Woodruff  ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, March 9, 1883.  Dear Brother Hinckley—I received your letter of Feby. 28, and have read it with care, and in reply would say that I do not expect you, in choosing a companion, to interfere with any president or bishop, or his counsellors, for there is generally plenty of persons in  the country who are willing to labor in such a cause without interfering with any of the organizations of the Church.  When I was in that country, we appointed quite a number of persons on the Lamanite mission. If you cannot get  any of them to go with you, look up some man who is willing to go without interfering with any of the organiza- tions of the Church. Brother L. Harris has written to  day that some one of the brethren has represented that he was in the favor of the chiefs of the Mohaves and that that was the cause of his being appointed to go there. I have un- derstood in your letters that it was his desire to settle there, and upon that ground we have appointed him, and Brother Mc Donald has informed me that he has appointed Brother Price W. Neilson and Perry Bingham to go with him. I got letters this morning from  Jesse N. Smith and L. Harris, to say that they want ENDENTRY him (Snowflake and attend to the Apaches, who are going to settle at Forest Dale. I do  not want Brother Harris to disappoint us in ma- king a settlement with the Mohaves. When he gets settled with them he can go to Snowflake on a visit,  if he wishes to assist about the Apaches, or anywhere else. But after this appointment he should make his home with the Mohaves, as he has been appointed,  for this is the arrangement we are now making with all the Lamanites, as far as we can. President Taylor has left this matter a great deal with me,  and I do not wish to interfere with the general organization of the Church in any part of the vineyard.  Your Brother in the Gospel,  W Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Oct. 19, 1882.  Elder Benjamin F. Johnson.  Dear Brother – I have received several  letters from you, giving an account of your travels and doings. All your letters have been laid before the Presidency of the Church and  Council, and the general feelings are  that you are going too far in your operations in engaging a large quantity of land in Arizona and expecting the authorities  of the Church to send large numbers of  men to pay for the land and occupy it.  You had permission to go to look out a  location for yourself and family and  were advised to make the location in some  part of Mexico, if possible, and it was expected that you would take your fam- ily from Utah, and not that you  would call those who had been called  to go to St. John, and who were sent there to strengthen that place, and who are  wanted there more than at Salt River. I have been gone some twenty days to  ENDENTRY Ashley's Fork, and I have also been other- wise engaged so that I could not write to  you to give such counsel in this matter,  as I have desired and would like to, if  I could get time. I should advise  you not to to make any purchases of land, excepting so much as you  may expect yourself and family to  pay for, or those associated with you. As the Church has taken much trouble  in paying for St. John, I do not wish  through my infleunce to put any more  upon them of that kind.  I do not  feel like advising those who are at St.  John to leave there and go to Salt River,  for they are wanted at St. John, and a  good many more, in order to hold  that place. There have been some  complaints about your going away with  your last wife well provided for and  leaving your others in a measure  unprovided for. We expected that  you were going south with the intention ENDENTRY of providing for all your family who  were in Utah. I have been in- formed that they have gone to you  since. I hope that you will be  enabled to provide a home for them all  and make them comfortable. I am  also in hopes that you will yet get  an opening in some portion of Mexico,  which is more desirable than to locate  in Arizona. I have written to  Brother McDonald upon this subject.  You give a glowing account of the  country where you are, and I hope  you will do well. Some of the  brethren here feel that I went too far in the recommend I gave you  in saying you were called by the First  Presidency and the Twelve to go to  Arizona and Mexico, etc. I should  have said that you had permission  to go, etc., for we all understood that  it was your request to go and find  a place for yourself and family.  ENDENTRY But I have said enough upon this  subject. I hope you will prosper,  but don't buy the whole country,  with the expectation that we can  send men from Utah to pay for it  and occupy it, for we have not  half enough spare men to fill up  the settlements we already have in  Arizona and other places. I shall be glad to hear from you and  learn how you get along.  Your brother in the Gospel.  W Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, May 9, 1882.  To Whom it May Concern:  This is to certify that Benjamin F. Johnson is called, by the Presidency and Twelve  Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints, to take his family; his wives, sons and daughters, and sons-in-law and their families, as far as circumstances will permit, and also his brother, Joseph E. Johnson, and his family, and go to Southern Mexico, and form a settlement, under the direction and counsel of A. F. Mc Donald. But is is our wish that Brother Johnson should make his settlement in some portion of Mexico, say Sonora. It is our wish that Brothers Johnson and Mc Donald unite together in their counsels and labors in the formation of the settlement, as wisdom may direct; and may the blessing of God rest upon Brother Johnson and all his efforts in forming a new settlement.  W. Woodruff  This call of Brother Johnson was by his own request, as he desired to get some place to settle his family and wished to go under the sanction of the authorities of the Church.  W Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, May 10, 1882.  Brother C. Hanson.  Your letter to President Taylor was handed to me to answer, and in reply I would say that I do not know who put your name down to go to Colorado, but it was some one in Colorado, who gave your name to Silas S. Smith, thinking that you could start a sawmill in that country, but, taking your age and circumstances into consideration, we feel to honorably release you from attempting to fill that mission.  Your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff. ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, May 24, 1882.  President Peterson.  Dear Brother—There is one  subject which Brother Richards and myself forgot to converse with you upon while at Ephraim. It is this—Pres- ident A. O. Smoot to go to Pleasant Valley and organize that  branch, and he wrote to you to do the same, forgetting probably that he had written to Brother Smoot upon  the same subject. He got ready to go and organize them, but heard that you had organized them. Now the question arises, Where should that branch belong? To Ephraim, or Provo? We have decided, in  council, that they should be united with Utah Stake, for the following  reasons—as they are all colliers and a railroad runs to their place, they can get on a car any day in the ENDENTRY year and go to Utah, while  six months in the year they can't get to Sanpete, and it is rather difficult to get there at any time of the year, in consequence of the moun- tains to cross, and no teams. So I hope this explanation will be satisfactory to you. I shall notify the Presiding Elder to attend the conference on the 3rd and 4th of June at Provo.  My love to yourself and family.  Your brother in the Gospel.  W Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, July 31, 1882.  Mr. Canute Peterson.  Dear Brother—Will you please forward to me the names of the three men and three women of your stake who are to go to St. George to work in the Temple the coming  winter? Can any of them get ready to go down with Brother McAllister, who leaves Salt Lake City the middle of August?  Your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, July 31, 1882.  Mr. D. H. Peery.  Dear Brother—Will you please forward to me the names of the two men and two women who are going from your Stake to Temple the coming winter? Can they be ready to go down with Brother Mc Allister, who leaves the city the middle of  August?  Your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City,  May 10, 1882.  Mr. David Boice,  Dear Brother—Your letter of April 4, was received in good time, but, through the multiplicity of business, it has not been answered before. Your letter to Silas S. Smith is also before me. In answer to your  questions I would say that if you were to go by railroad you would take cars at Denver, from there to Manassa, where you will land at your place of settlement. If you go with teams, you will go through Sanpete, then over the moun- tains east to Grand Rivers, go by Parrott City on to Manassa, Colorado. We would like you to go as soon as you can sell and close up your business. Be careful about forming acquain- tances and familiarity with strangers while on your journey, for the whole country abounds with tramps and robbers, who will steal your money whenever they can. If you have money and take the railroad, you save time. If you go with teams, you are longer, but have your teams when you get there. So you must act according to circumstances.  Your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff. ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Sept. 23rd, 1882.  David Booth.  Brigham City.  Dear Brother:  On my return from  a mission of twenty days, I found  your letter of August 29th, and in  reply would say that the object of  this call of persons to go to St. George to labor was in a measure to release some of those who have labored there for years; and it was intended to call those who were able  to go on a mission and able to  support themselves. Those who go  can get half fare on the South- ern rail road, as I understand.  I think there is no difficulty in  ENDENTRY renting places there. As to provisions I expect they will be rather scarce. But I do not know of any one  taking provisions with them to much  extent. One thing I wish to say to  you, that it is necessary for you  to take a recommend from your  wife  should prepare herself with plain  dresses—not tie back nor frills, andc, as they are not permitted to be  worn in the temple. I think of  nothing more at this time in answ- er to your questions.  Your Brother in the Gospel,  W. Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City March 25 1882  David K Udal  Dear Brother  I receved your letter of March 9, and read it with much interest It was read to president Taylor and Council. I was much pleased with the organization you have been enabled to make in St John. And the prospect you seem to have of paying off the Debt of that place and that you are prospering in your business. I have always had a good deal of anxiety about St John from the time we first made the purchase I believe you will be successful in the final Settlement of ENDENTRY the place concerning emigration to Arizona it has been quite difficult to  get enough people willing to go to the places pointed out for them to settle in, in order for us to accomplish what we have desired. It has been hard work for us to get enough to  go to St John. We called about 20 to go to Manassa while Br E. Snow was with us of late And there is now call for settlers to go to almost every new settlement we are forming  We will endeavor to influence as many as we can to go to St. John In speaking of the stock  owned by Brethren who are in St John which Stock is in Southern Utah president Taylor wishes to know what the price of that stock is ENDENTRY whether it is Cash price or at 100 cts on the Dollar He considers the Stock that was turned out on the purchase was at cash price. He would take stock on the Southern heards in the same way  Concerning your Election Matters It does appear to me that our people should take advantage of any arrangements that Can be Made with outside parties in reason to secure a part of those offices I think you had better  write to Br Jesse N Smith upon that subject and obtain some of the rights which belong to our  people if possible remember me kindly to Br. Tenney and all my friends who inquire  Your Brother in the Gospel W Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Oct. 27, 1882.  Elder David K. Udall.  Dear Brother—Your letter and ac- counts of Sept. 12 have been in my hands quite a length of time and also in the  President's office. I have been waiting, thinking I might get some counsel  upon the subject from the Presidency, but have not up to the present time. So I feel it my duty to answer your letter as well as I can. In the first place I will say that I realize that you need help and numbers. It has seemed  a hard matter to get men of means to go to St. John and settle. They have seemed to want to go anywhere else  to settle but there, and when they get there they want to go somewhere else.  I do not consider this right. I think  our people can do as well in St. John  as anywhere else in Arizona. I want to say in reference to Brother B. F.  Johnson, who has gone to Salt River,  ENDENTRY that he went there by his own request. He had permission to go to get a location  for himself and family, but was advised  to settle in some part of Old Mexico, if he  could. He had permission to look  up a place to settle his own family,  or those that were here in Utah. We did not expect him to call those  of his family, or anybody else, who  were in St. John. We sent them there to strengthen that place, and  we prefer they would stay there to  maintain that country. With regard  to your accounts, I have put them  into the hands of Brother Jack to  look over and file for reference. As far as I can use any influence to  get others to go to St. John, I will. I realize that you want more help. I  am glad you have made some ar- rangements with the Barths on the  election, so as to get some of the offices, for the way they are going on they  ENDENTRY will soon ruin the country. We  feel deeply interested in the Indian  missions throughout the whole coun- try. I had great hopes that  Ammon M. Tenney would take hold of that work, as he is acquainted  with the Islatas, Navajoes, etc., and I think he could  do more good on the Indian mission  than any other way. We are  organizing all the Indian missions  in the territories, as far as we can. President Taylor received a revelation  in which Heber  J. Grant were called to fill the va- cancies in the Quorum of the Twelve, and Abram  H. Cannon were called to fill the  vacancies in the first presidency of  the Seventies, all of whom have  been ordained.  We are now having warm pleasant weather, to get potatoes dug and ploughing done, etc. ENDENTRY Remember me kindly to Bros. Gibbons, and Romney, and any enquiring friends with  you. I am always glad to  hear from you.  Your brother in the Gospel.  W Woodruff ENDENTRY Mar. 18, 1882  Bp. E. W. McIntire, Paragoonah.  Dear Brother: Will you please  notify Hiram Schofield of your ward that  he has been called by the authorities of the  Church to take his family and settle in San Luis Valley, Colorado, under the direction  of Prest. Silas S. Smith? The land route lies  east through Green River, crossing  in Grand Valley, thence  by the southwestern base of Elk Mountain to  Coyote Creek and on to Mancos, Colorado, and  thence eastward over Continental divide to Conejos,  San Luis Valley on the Rio Grande Del Norte.  Respectfully,  Your Brother, W. Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Nov. 13, 1882.  Elder Edward Faulkner.  Dear Brother—I received your letter  of Nov. 9, and I feel disposed to answer it, but I have not had time to give it the consid- eration that I could wish, yet I will  endeavor to answer the several questions  according to the light I have at present. First, the work for the dead that has been  done in the endowment house, I consider  has been done by the priesthood and legal  authority, which is acceptable, and the  work is not necessary to be done over again. I consider it right that we should do for the  dead all that we do the living, as far as  the ordinances of the Gospel are concerned, for life and salvation in the celestial king- dom of God.  I consider the dead are of  account, as well as the living, in this  respect.  I consider that those who were  sealed to you, who were dead, were sealed  lawfully and rightly.  It is true, that  ENDENTRY if a man rejected the patriarchal law of  marriage, and then had dead persons  sealed to him to evade that law, thinking  he would obtain the same glory as though  he had kept the law, he probably would  fail in his calculations.  I should judge,  from the manifestations you had received  concerning the two dead persons, it was an  evidence that it was right for you to have  them sealed to you.  I don't think the  time will ever come when dead folks will be ever played out, until all the dead  are redeemed that can be.  As far  as the Lord opens the way before us,  it is our duty to fulfil the whole law  of God.  Your brother in the Gospel,  W. Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Feby. 6, 1883.  Dear Brother Cannon.  I have felt for a long time that I ought  to write to you, and still I hardly felt that I had any news of importance to communicate, except  what you get from the President's Office and the  "News." But the same anxiety that formerly rested upon us concerning your labors while in  Washington has not diminished since you went there this time. I listened with much interest this morning to the reading of your letter to President Taylor, concerning the plea of yourself, Brother Black before the House Judiciary committee and the uphill work Van Zile meets with in trying  to carry out his hellish plan to rob the Saints of their civil and political rights. You and those associated with you in Washington still  have the prayers of all Israel that dwells in these mountains for your success, and, which is better than all the rest, we know that God and the justified spirits made ENDENTRY perfect, with all the heavenly hosts, are your  friends and on your side. Therefore, your  enemies cannot prevail against you, and  I will here say, in the name of the Lord, that whatever He permits, in connection with Congress and our affairs, after you have done your duty, will prove for the best good of Zion and her inhabitants and for the condemnation and overthrow of our ene- mies. Congress will go no further a- gainst us than the Lord permits, and it will turn for our good. We have been travelling a good deal of late and holding meetings, and we have had good meetings, a great deal of  the spirit of the Lord has been poured out upon the Presidency and the Twelve in our public teaching, the houses have been packed wherever we have been, and the Saints are waking up. We have had excellent meetings with the  young people. You will see from the "News" that we organized a new presidency at Ogden, by appointing Bishop Shurtleff president, and  ENDENTRY Brothers Flygare counsellors, and at Wm. Paxman president and Brothers Joel Grover and Charles Sperry counsellors. We have also voted to form a new stake in southern  St. David and another settlement, appointing C. Layton president,  and Martineau counsellors. This will be near the borders of Mexico, and from them a settlement is to be formed in Mexico. We feel that this is in  the right direction. Brothers Young and Grant are in their field of labor, but I do not learn much of what they are doing. I had a letter from Arza Hinckley a few days since. He was among the Wallapais and Mojaves. The Mojave chief wanted some of our people to settle with them and teach them to farm. They are said to be a noble class of men. Bro- ther L. Harris wishes to settle there, and I think we shall advise him to do so. The second  chief of the Mojaves can read English. Brother Hinckley left with him the Voice of Warning, and he wants a Book of Mormon, which ENDENTRY we have sent you saw the letter I received from Brother Christianson before you left, giving an account that he had baptized twenty- seven and ordained one an elder, who had received four administrations of messengers, three at one time, who taught him from five to eight hours, and informed him that there would soon be war and famine throughout the whole land, except in Zion, etc.  Concerning the health of the country, the  Presidency and Twelve are as well as usual.  Brother John Pack has a relapse and is very low. Neither is ex- pected to live. Mrs. H. S. Eldredge is out again. Angus M.  Cannon has had a relapse and is con- fined to his house. I understand that your son who broke his leg is doing well. Erastus Snow was very poorly when he arrived home, but is now in St. George and getting better. Remember me kindly to Brother Richards, and all friends with  you. That our heavenly Father will clothe  you all with the power of God and the ENDENTRY revelations of Jesus Christ and give you the victory over all your enemies, and that Judge Black will be numbered  among the prophets because of inspiration and power to defend the right, is the  earnest prayer of your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff ENDENTRY Mar. 18, 1882  Bp. Geo. W. Ward, Willard City.  Dear Brother: Will you please notify Jacob A. Brimhall of your ward that he has been called by the authorities of the Church to take his family and settle in San Luis Valley, Colorado, under the direction of Prest. Silas S. Smith. The land route lies east through Green River, crossing in Grand Valley, thence by the southwestern base of Elk Mountain to Coyote Creek and on to Mancos, Colorado, and thence eastward over Continental divide  to Conejos, San Luis Valley on the Rio Grande  Del Norte.  Respectfully,  Your Brother, W Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, June 15, 1882.  Mr. James G. Bleak.  Dear Brother—It was decided in coun- cil for Brother Folsom to put into the hands of Brother Allman the plan for the tower and other buildings of St. George Temple, and for him to pro- ceed at once to St George to superintend the work and assist in their erection, and as the season was advancing we thought it should not be delayed. Brother Allman understands the plans and can work to them probably better than Brother Barnes or any one who has not been with Brother Folsom. There was considerable annoyance yesterday in the President's Office because we could not get any answer to our telegram. I sent mine early in the morn- ing, but they said you were in the Temple, and could not get it until 2 o'clock. Brother Folsom waited all day and wanted to telegraph to Brother Allman and return to Manti himself. The operator said you got the telegram at 2 o'clock, and did not answer, ENDENTRY but went to the spring. I then telegraphed to Brother McAllister, but he had gone to the spring with you, and we got no answer until about 7 o'clock, which hindered Brother Folsom from going home. We thought you could have answered yes or no, which would have been a relief to us, and have relieved the feelings of impatient men who had been waiting all day. I think you ought to start the limekiln immediately. The plan will be there before you will want to use it. I should get all the materials on the ground as soon as I could. I think Brother Thompson can help about putting up the buildings. It has been so long before we could get the matter decided by the Presidency that we now ought to finish it up without delay. Our Convention delegates have gone to Wash- ington to ask for a State Government. The dispatches say that G. Q. Cannon is to draw his pay up to the day the seat was declared vacant.

In reply I would say  that Brother Folsom was instructed to get  out that plan for the engine house and  eating house, to be built on the north side  of the Temple, and forward it to you or  Brother Bleak, and have them go on and  build it. I have just written to Brother  Folsom to forward the plan as soon as  possible. It is the mind of Brother  Taylor and Brother Folsom that you  should employ Brother Barnes to build  the tower and engine house, etc.  Concerning the missionaries sent to  work in the Temple, it is expected to be  a free will offering, and to send per- sons who are able to take care of them- selves. It is not at all ENDENTRY expected that the St. George Stake will support them. We do not wish to  require you to write the ceremonies for the Logan Temple. Bro. Taylor can  have them written here when necessary. We are thankful to learn of the good success in digging for water. I am glad of the im- provement on the Temple Block. Brother Nuttall will forward the list of workers and  wages as soon as he can get them out. It has been very dry and cold here. We are thankful to say it is raining some today, as the earth needs it. I received Brother Bleak's and Farnsworth's letters. Sister Zina arrived in safety, all well. Our mission- aries are doing well. I should judge they had baptized 100 since Bro. Morgan returned. They baptized 50 in April.  Your brother in the Gospel.  W Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, May 11, 1882.  President Morgan,  Dear Brother—I received your interesting letter of April 21,  also that of May 5. Both were very interesting. In your first  letter you give an account of your labors up to date, which shows  that you performed a great deal of labor in a short time. Your  last letter shows that the work is spreading rapidly in that coun- try, for which I feel thankful to the Lord, and to his servants who are  laboring faithfully to warn the nation and save the souls of men  who are willing tobe saved. Quite a number of the southern  members of Congress took a stand against the Edmunds bill and  the returning board, for they know how it is themselves. I think  their speeches have done much good, and there still seem to  be doors open in the south for the Gospel, far more than in the north,  and the Lord is blessing you and your companions in the Gospel  in a wonderful manner, considering that it is the gleaning  time.  Brother Cannon still remains on the battle ground,  to do whatever good he can.  Quite a number of those who voted against  his taking his seat have apologized to him since, saying they knew they  had done the meanest act of their lives in depriving him of his seat,  and their only excuse was that the party and country required it at  ENDENTRY their hands. But that is an awful state for a nation to get into.  The best legal minds in the nation are satisfied that the Edmunds  bill is unconstitutional, and that, if any action upon it was  carried up to the supreme-court of the United States, it would be  condemned, if that body had independence of mind to decide con- stitutionally.  All is peace in Zion. No excitement with  leading men. But the anti-Mormons still hold meetings  and are filled with wrath and bitterness because we wont give up the  Kingdom of God, and join the Devil and serve him. But that we do  not feel disposed to do. We had a good Conference at Logan. The  Temple was going on bravely. There has been expended upon  that building $388,048.11. We are expecting to finish the working portion of that Temple this season.  It is a general  time of health with the Presidency and Twelve. Brother John Pack and  Mother Mary Ann Young are both very low. We buried Brother  Jacob Gibson a short time ago.  With regard to Brother  Cowley, I wrote him and also yourself a hasty scawl, giving  him the privilege of tarrying as long as he felt a desire to.  He did not wish tobe released on account of his health. He  thought he was enjoying fair health. But I noticed in  the photographic group of yourself, Cowley, and others, that he seemed to look quite thin. But he seemed very  sensitive and wanted to stay his time out, and we are  ENDENTRY willing to give him the privilege. I think it would  be well for him after awhile to come home and take a  rest. But it is left for him and yourself to say when  he shall be released.  We are always glad to hear from  you. My love to all the Saints and Elders with you.  Your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff.  ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Aug. 14, 1882.  Dear Brother Morgan—Your letter of  July 19 arrived in good time, but I have delayed answering until I could get Presi- dent Taylor's views upon the subject of your release. The letter was read to him on the 12th, and I got his views today from Brother Nuttall. President Taylor thinks that it would be well for you to tarry until fall, until the emigration is over for this season, and then for you to set in order the church there and appoint a good trusty man to take charge, and for you then to come home and take a rest, and then we could talk over about the future. I am thankful to see such a good progress of the work of God under your adminis- tration. Brother Cowley arrived home all safe, but had his big toe nail ENDENTRY pulled out by the roots by Dr. Benedict, the day after his arrival, to see if a new nail would not give him less pain. This has laid him up for several weeks. Yesterday was the first time he has spoken in the Big Tabernacle. He spoke one hour and a half, to a minute, on the first principles of the Gospel. He did exceedingly well, and the  only fault I could find with it was, it was too long. He quoted  chapter and verse to prove all he said. We had many strangers, who gave good attention. There is considerable interest manifest in Governor's privilege to appoint officers in this territory. The ground we take is that there are no vacancies, as all officers hold over until their successors are elected and qualified. We shall probably have ENDENTRY to contend for this by law. It is a gen- eral time of health with us at present. You will see by the "Deseret News" that we have buried Bishops Reuben Miller, A. C. Pyper,  and Thos. W. Winter. Give my love to the elders with you.  Your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff. ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Oct. 27, 1882.  Elder John Morgan.  Dear Brother – Your letter of  Oct. 17 is received, and has been  read by the Presidency. Quite a  number were called at conference for  the southern mission. I think  about 30 in all, which I hope will  be a help there. I will say con- cerning Elder B. H. Roberts, whom  you named, that he had already  been called to fill another place. I should judge the way for you  to do would be to take the most available man you have already  in the mission to leave to preside  for the time being. We had a very  good conference. I think the teaching and testimony were by inspiration ENDENTRY You will see by the papers that Geo. Teas- dale and Heber J. Grant have been ordained to fill the vacancies in the Quorum of the Twelve,  and Seymour B. Young and Abram H. Cannon  to fill the vacancies in the First presidency of the Seventies. I think you are much blessed in your missions in  the South, much more so than those in the north.  John Henry Smith starts to-morrow for England to  release Albert Carrington to return home.  It is a general time of health with us and pleasant weather. We have had good crops, and especially a fine crop of po- tatoes, notwithstanding the Edmunds bill. I think the people outside of Utah have been more troubled about our affairs  than we have. I am pleased that  you have good rates for your emigration.

It is  too late in the season to procure a wellqualified teacher  through the Normal Dept. of this Logan Col= lege, and Collett to make some temporary  arrangements the best way he could for this winter,  and next year we should find a competent Principal  for their Churchschool.  From the efforts made by the  people of Grantsville to erect and fit up such a cred= itable schoolbuilding by donation, I conclude, that  it has been done not only with the sanction of the  Tooele Stake Board of Education but that it is  also the intention of that latter body to make that  institution at Grantsville their Stake Academy. I did not touch that subject in my conversation with  Bishop Collett, fearing to provoke perhaps an issue similar to the one between Farmington and Kaysville.

Others can be found, no doubt, in your Stake who can attend to this, and who could not  do some of the work, at least, that Brother Talmage is doing.

It seems that he has been excommunic- -ated for adultery. We desire you and the High Council to examine this case, and if you  find that his repentance is genuine, you can take the necessary steps to grant his request and have him baptized and confirmed a member of the church; but whatever former blessings  he has had, do not bewtow them upon him ENDENTRY at the present time.

Woolley 9th Ward  Dear Brother:  Upon a statement which you make to  me concerning Annie C. Riter, or Annie C. Riter Ander- son and the prompt manner in which she paid her tithes and  offerings and attended meetings, and showed by her conduct that  she was sincerely contrite and desired to repent of her wrong do- ing during the remainder of her life after she fell into sin, I feel led to say to you, and through you to her mother and relations, that  they can be baptized for her and have all her former blessings  sealed in her behalf upon the one who officiates for her.  A per- son organized as you say she was deserves charity, and she has  gone now to meet her final account; but her record, as you report  it, after the sad occurrence which caused her severance from the  Church, shows that she had faith in the Gospel and had good  desires for herself and her children.  Before, however, speaking to her mother upon this, it would be  well for you to show this letter to the Presidency of the Stake - Bro Angus M. Cannon and Counselors - and let them know my  views upon this subject so that whatever is done may be done   ENDENTRY with their knowledge.  The second case that woman who  has been the third wife of a High Priest, etc, is so mixed up  that we cannot get a clear view of the case, and I would not  like to give you counsel respecting it till I can get a better understanding of the whole affair.  This woman asks to have  "the seal broken with the old man and to get sealed to her pre- sent husband."  This is a serious request and cannot be  granted without there are good reasons for doing so.  The  ordinances of the House of God are too sacred to be trifled  with.  If there are good reasons, however, for her request to  be granted, they ought to be considered.  You next speak of persons married by Judges or  Justices of the Peace, who afterwards pay their tithing and  perform their other Church duties, hoping to get the  privilege of being recommended.  Where such persons  are rebaptized, and reform in their lives, and bring forth  good fruits, so as to convince the officers of the Church  and their brethern and sisters that they really desire to be Latter-day Saints, I can see no reason why they  should not be, at the proper time, recommended, if they  wish to go the Temple to be sealed.  The case which you mention of the sister who  is married to an outsider who is bitter, and who herself ENDENTRY takes lively interest in the work and does what she can  towards helping the Manti Temple, and in tithing  and other matters, is one that appeals strongly to our  sympathy, but I scarely think it would be proper  for her to go to the Temple and and receive her endowments  A woman in her condition ought to be able to go with illegible her husband.

E. Taylor, in which he states to us the action  of the High Council, to the effect that the High Council feel that they have  no discretionary power in such cases as his, and that they could only present  the facts and leave the matter with the First Presidency to determine, although the spirit of humility and repentance which Brother Shaw manifested was so marked  that it made a deep impression upon the Council.  Since receiving this communication we have taken the whole subject of  such transgressions into consideration, and we wish now to say to you, and through  you to the High Council, that cases of this character you are at liberty to de- cide upon according to the evidence that may be presented and ^as^ the Spirit of the  Lord is manifested to you in the consideration of each case.

Dear Brethren:- At a meeting of the High Council held on  the 23rd ult; the question of a larger and more suitable place in  which to meet as a Council, and for an Office for the Presidency  of the Stake, came up for consideration, when the following  Resolution  was adopted by unanimous vote:  Whereas, The room now occupied as a place of meeting by the  High Council of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion is not all suitable  for the purpose, being too small to accommodate the Council and  parties litigant, and the number of witnesses which are frequently  in attendance.  The room is badly ventilated, being hot in summer and cold in winter; besides, the surroundings are unpleasant, the  cellars being sometimes filled with potatoes and other vegetables, the odor from which is not only disagreeable but unhealthful. Therefor,  Be it Resolved by the High Council of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion that the Presidency of the Salt Lake Stake be and are hereby  requested to consult the First Presidency of the Church and if  consistent secure rooms more suitable for the use of the High Council  and as an office for the Presidency of the Stake.

Dear Brother—Having permission from Pres- ident I inclose in his letter to you a  few lines which I am here at the quarterly Stake  Conference, which closed yesterday. We had an exceeding good time, good instruction, and a  good time prevailed.  The Lamanites is  what I desire to write you about, as I know  that will interest you.  We, the brethren  of Moenkopi, baptized 27 in the last three months  of the Piute branch tribe in the northern boun- daries of this territory, and the administering  of that ordinance of the Gospel has been attend- ed with uncommon good result and a  better understanding, as holy messengers,  as we have good reason to believe, have  administered to one of them, a lame  man, a most peculiar man, which would  indicate that God takes of the weak things  to do his great pleasure, etc. The admi- nistration is something after this manner  —two or more persons appeared to him, ENDENTRY introducing himself as the Creator of all things,  or common Father, etc., telling them of  this once beautiful earth and also that  it would soon be so again, telling them  of the great war which would prevail  amongst all people, except those who  did certain things as desired by him  (their Father).  Also that there would  be peace amongst the Mormons and  that they were the head, and they, the  Indians, must not reject them, but  follow in our footsteps.  Many common  simple instructions, such as were adap- ted to their condition of life. This con- versation lasted something like six or  eight hours. Many things which he  could not remember or even tell, even  many things that he understood in his  heart.  Another vision, a short time  ago a man, about six feet or over, red  hair and beard, told him that all must  be baptized, etc., and that the Mormons  would have three years of plenty, and  after that time worse and worse ENDENTRY everywhere.  However, not teaching  anything about the fall of man or the  redemption, nor the atonement, but  plain things, such as they can com- prehend, and they do most assuredly  believe.  I do not desire to weary  you, as I know you can judge by the  spirit the intent of the mission of those  messengers.  I have not told you  all the simple conversation that the  Indian communicated to me, but  have given you the groundwork, condensed  onto a small piece of paper, which you  will understand how limited. We  ordained him an elder, and he is  doing more good than our language  that we have learned can do. Thank God for these blessings.  The  people of the Moenkopi are quite well.  Raised an uncommon good crop. Nine  members removed, few remain, and  their work are increasing and requires  great patience and all the power with  our heavenly Father we gan get. ENDENTRY Many are sick amongst the La- monites.  We are under the necessity  of administering to them continually,  spiritual and temporal.  The Na- ajoes are slow to believe, also the  Moquis, the former being a very  proud people and the latter a very  superstitious race.  Still, they are  looking for something uncommon. God bless all his works.  Your brother in the Gospel, Christian Lingo Christensen, of Moenkopi.  P.S.  I would ask you to write me  a line, did I not know your hurry of  business. Remember me in your  prayers.  C. L. C. ENDENTRY Salt Lake City Oct 18th 1893  To the Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints  I was sent to the Church office  in Copenhagen the 7 of May 1892 to write  the Swedish Star but when I had been  there till the 22nd day of January 1893, then I feel in transgression with a girl that  I loved and who had promised me  that she would be my wife.  We used to  go together, and when the President of the  Mission saw that, he told me kindly  to stop going with her; but I am sorry  to say, that I did not listen to his good  council.  I was not strong enough to resist  the temptation, and I feel now the consequences.  I was sent to Sweden, and while  there I received a letter from her, that  she was in family way.  I had felt bad  all the time ever since the crim was  committed - the Spirit greived me.  I may state, that I never had any  ENDENTRY intercourse with her but once,  As soon  as I received the letter I released  myself and went to Coenhagen and  acknowledge my guilt, which in fact  I should have done long before, but  I could not see the awfulness of the sin untill it was committed and then shame  and sorrow took possession of me, and  it had to work its time and open my  eyes, as it were.  I came to Zion when  I was 14 yeas of age, with the full intention  of serving God and I have all ways tried  my best to do so.  The Brethren in Europe were kind to me; especially Apostel Anthon H. Lund did all he could to help me.  I was married in Copenhagen (Brother  Lund advised me to do so) and my wife  are now here.  I am full of sorrow and  grief over what I have done and most  humbly beg forgiveness; My heart and soul are with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, for  out of it I know there is no Salvation.  My aim shall be to do all I can ENDENTRY to atone for the sin I have committed. I cannot live happy outside of the Church,  so I pray please forgive me what I  have sinned against God and His servants.  Respectfully Gust. A. Anderson ENDENTRY 513 October 18th 1893.

The case is like this  Br Brockbank loaned Br Fox three thousand dollars several years go., the interest was paid until Br Fox became involved through the financial panic.  Br Brockbank pressed the case to a trial, the  result was that Br Fox acknowledged the debt, also his total inability to meet it, but was  willing to do so as soon as he was able  Our decision was that he should do as above  stated:  What else could we do?  Knowing  tolerably well the state of Br Fox'es affairs, that  his home was heavily mortgaged,  That the banks  held his farm, That he had collatted everything  he had in the world, And that he was trying to  save something from the general wreck for his ENDENTRY large family to subsist upon, We cannot see how we  can decide differently from what we have done.  And  say that a man shall do, what he solemnly declares  he cannot do.  Br B's claim is a just  one, as far as it goes; but Br Fox claimes to have paid  at sundry times amounts reducing it about one  third, also that he has had to pay notes that they  had jointly signed.  Br Brockbank told us that he  wished to get it through the Church Courts, that he  might take it to the law Courts and get a Judgment.  We told him that he could take an appeal, but  he says that the President of the High Councel will  not accept it on such a decision; And so the  Matter stands.  We have had them togather several times  since the trial, but cannot accomplish anything  I am very sorry that you should be troubled  with this matter, but I have done all that I couuld  do. under the circumstances, and dont think we are  holding back the case  Your brother in the Gospel George H.

Dear Brother—Your letter of March 31 arrived in good time, but it has been in President Taylor's office a week, with other documets for him to read, yet through the multiplicity of  business he was not able to attend to it until yesterday. I also  read a long letter from Arza Hinckley, containing 25 pages, all the testimony at the trial of Dan. W. Jones, all the testi- mony against him, etc. When he found that there was a  power in the Church that could reach him, he came to and made his confession, and he wrote a strong confession to  President Taylor. I hope he will remember this and keep  humble, and, if he does anything in the Church, that he will do right and not defraud the Indians or white men, either Saints or Gentiles. You will find inclosed in this letter an order to cover the amount that you gave Brother Har- ris to fit him out. I sent him a letter, and directed it, as he told me, to Fort Mohave, Mohave Co., Arizona. After  it was gone three weeks, it was sent back to me. There is either no post office there, or he did not call for the letter. I will send it again to you in an open envelop. I wish you to read it and then seal it up and send it to him if you know where it can reach him. I will also write to  Arza Hinckley, which I wish you to read and then send to him. I do not know where to reach him. I think it would be well for Brother Harris to have his wife and  family with him, to take care of and see to them. I am ENDENTRY quite inclined to think that Brother Harris is not much of a financier, but likes to travel around, more than to be located in one place. They being under your presidency and jurisdiction, you will have to see about these things, and give him counsel and those brethren that are with him, that they may arrange their matters so as to be a benefit to  the Lamanites, and carry on their temporal matters wisely. If Brother Harris is placed to preside in that mission, you will have to appoint two of the brethren who are with him as his counsellors, and it would be well to appoint the best financier probably as his first counsellor, but then  you must use your own judgement in these matters. All is well as  usual with us. If you see Brothers Grant, give my love to them, tell them I have written them at David K. Udall, and I suppose he will send it to them. I also received a letter from B. F Johnson, and the Presidency has decided that he may be ordained a patriarch when any of the Twelve visit that country. Give my love to your family and the Saints with you. I am glad to hear from you at any time. In looking over Brother Hinckley's letter, he says Brother Harris wants some books. Now I do not know how many he wants, nor what kind he wants. I do  not suppose the Mohaves can read English, unless it may be Haskett. I  wish you would inform me, if you know, what they want, and how books can be sent to them. Mesa is a long way from Fort Mo- have. I do not wish to send books there, for them not to be obtained by the bre- thren. As I have said, I shall direct the letters to Brothers Hinckley  and Harris to you at Mesa, and you can forward to them, until  I know how to direct to them. Your brother in the Gospel, W. Woodruff.

I will now say  that you have a large circle of friends, who deeply sym- pathize with you in your afflictions and you have the  consolation of knowing that you are not imprisoned  for the cause of theft, robbery, burglary or murder, or any  other crime known in the black catalogue, but your  imprisonment is for conscience's sake in endeavoring  to carry out in practice one of the tenets of your  religion, and we hope and trust that this fact, in  connection with your good behaviour, and strict observance  of the rules of the prison will give you favor in the  eyes of your warden, that he will be willing to grant  you all the privileges that the rules of the prison may  permit. I would like to be informed if you will  be permitted to receive ^and read^ the Deseret News as published in  ENDENTRY this city. If so we will send them to you.

All will be done that can be— legally and lawfully, by your friends for your  release until the final decision in the higher  courts. You will be remembered by all your  friends in your afflictions.

Dear Brother:  Mr. Charles Ellis had a conversation with us yesterday morning re- garding the work that he is now engaged in, namely, delivering a course of Sun- day evening lectures at the Salt Lake Theatre.  He is working, in his way, in the interest of peace and right and is anxious to see the best possible good  result from his labors.  We are in full sympathy with Mr. Ellis not only in  what he is now doing but in what he has done in this direction; and we feel that the  Bishops of the city wards can do much to assist him at the present time by kind- ly reminding the people at the close of each Sunday evening services of his lec- ture, and by speaking a kindly word for him.  He says that on last Sunday night  he had a considerable number of non-Mormon people among his audience, but that  the house was by no means full.  He, of course, would prefer to speak to a full  house than a house only partly full; the presence, therefor, of our people at  his lectures would, at least, be an evidence of our appreciation of his labors.  Mr. Ellis suggested that we try to procure for him a little music, either vocal or instrumental or both; he thought this would have the effect of  making the lectures more popular.  We mention this last suggestion for your con- sidertion ^only^.  We would be pleased to have you do what you can consistently to  aid Mr. Ellis in making his lectures a success.

Salt Lake City, Utah   April 17, 1894.  Prests.  Angus M. Cannon Jos. E. Taylor, Charles E. Penrose,  Dear Brethren:-  In considering the regulations for the better maintenance of good order in the Tabernacle, we have decided to suggest to you that a  corps of ushers be organized, which you may call deacons, if you please, with a suitable man at their head ( a judicious, gentlemanly, well-mann- ered man) for the purpose of seating the people, preventing noises and unnecessary walking backwards and forwards, and to maintain general good order during the services in the Tabernacle.  They should be instructed to treat the people with kindness and consideration, but by their presence and the repressing of all unnecessary noise, either in walking or conversation, it would be their duty to preserve that quietude which should ever be maintained in th house of the Lord, and when the worship of God is being attended to by his people.  Complaints are made to us that because of the noises and confusion which exist in the remote parts of the house many of the saints who go to meeting for the purpose of being instructed are prevented from nearing and understanding what is being said.  This should not be. Unruly persons ought to be repressed and be made to feel that no disorder or improper conduct can be permitted during our public services. These ushers also can use their influence and authority in helping mothers with crying babies, either to obtain seats near the door, where they can easily pass out, or to help them reach the door, so that the ENDENTRY 2  congregation might not be disturbed by the cries of the children.  Another point we wish to call to your attention, we have had frequent complaints made to us concerning the ventilation of the Tabernacle, and now many persons suffer from the bad air they are  compelled to breathe while attending services there.  It is alleged that because of this bad air it is difficult to resist the inclination to sleep.  There can be no two opinions of the unhealthfulness of a badly ventilated room, and no man or woman can worship the Lord with that fervor and profit where they are inhaling poisonous atmosphere that they would feel and receive if the air were pure.  We have decided to suggest to you that Dr. Talmage be appointed to take charge of this business of ventilating the Tabernacle, and when it shall be necessary to use the heating apparatus, that he also have charge of that--not to do the work himself, but to see that the building is properly ventilated, and, in the winter time, heated.  His scientific knowledge will enable him to do this probably as satisfactorily as it is possible with such a building.  It would be well, if you approve of our suggestion, that the man whom you appoint to take charge of the corps of ushers should be instructed to received suggestions or orders from Dr. Talmage concerning these points, and, through him, the deacons or ushers be told what to do about opening or closing windows or doors.  Such an arrangement, we think, will be more simple than for the Doctor to tell the deacons himself.  We think this matter of sufficient importance to impress it upon you and, through you,  upon the Bishops of the several wards, so that our worship may be free from every objectionable feature, such as bad ventilation or disorder in the congregation.  We desire Bro. Thomas and all who have been performing these duties heretofore to understand that it is our wish that these arrange- ments shall be strictly carried out.  Of course, it is not intended to take from Bro. Thomas the care of the Tabernacle but to have these ENDENTRY 3  arrangements, which you will make, carried out strictly according to our suggestions.  Praying the Lord to bless you, we remain,  Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon Jos. F. Smith ENDENTRY
