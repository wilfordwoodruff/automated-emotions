April 17th 1894 Frist Presidency relating to ushers to preserve order in the Tabernacle. ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, March 26, 1883.  Dear Brother A. E. Hinckley.  I write to say that your letter of March 15 is before me. Concerning Bro- ther Harris' going to Jesse N.  Smith, conveying an idea that he would like to go there, and Jesse N. Smith sent me a letter, including Brother Harris' letter to him, both rather wishing for him to be there awhile, but a man cannot be in but one place at once, and as he has been appointed to go to the Mohaves and already gone, that is all right, and I think that is the place where he should be, for the present at least. With regard to that and all other organizations of the Lamanite missions, they should all be  under the presidency of the stakes in which they are organized, and the presidents of the stakes, under the direction of the Twelve Apostles,  and they under the direction of First Presidency of the Church,  and as President Taylor has put this mission into the hands of the Twelve to direct, what we do we do by his counsel, and all these things should be done according to the order of the Kingdom of God. If I understand it, the Mohave mission will be under the superin- tendency of A. F. McDonald, or within the limits of his jurisdic- tion. Therefore Brother Harris should consult with Brother Mc Donald in the general direction of that mission and keep us advised  of all matters appertaining to its workings. If you can get the man you spoke of to go with you, that is all right, as you want  some one to be with you who interpret your teachings,  so that they can be understoood by the Lamanites.  Your brother in the Gospel,  W. Woodruff.  ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, June 22, 1883.  Sister Melville's. I have stated to him my situation, away from home a great deal of the time attending conferences, and having a heavy correspondence and being full of business, so that I cannot do justice in answering so many critical questions as you ask in your letter, but I will answer the best I can. I shall also have to answer for Mrs. Woodruff, for she is not in a situation to write letters as much at present, not being in very good health. You say that you have a great desire to communicate with your daughter since her death, and have prayed for it long and loud, and the request is not granted you, and you feel sorely tried because it is not, and are almost ready to turn infidel because the Lord does not grant your request. I wish to say to you, Sister Gibbs, that you are asking something of the Lord that it is not wisdom in him to bestow. As soon as the spirit leaves the body and goes back to the Father who gave it, there are laws govern- ing that spirit, so that it cannot return to its friends on earth, and if it was granted to spirits it might cost them a great deal of sorrow. I have known persons to make covenants together to return after death to visit a husband, wife, or parents, but after death they never came back to fulfil their pledges, for they found a law to forbid it. To answer all such questions, I will say that the Lord never sends an angel to the earth to visit any body, unless He has a message to be delivered or a work to be performed that can- not be attended to otherwise; and the same with departed spirits, they never return to communicate with the living on the earth, only by permission ENDENTRY to deliver a message, but not to gratify the desire of husband or wife, parents, or children, and in that light you should look upon it, and not because you have done wrong, or because the Lord does not hear your prayer. Orson Pratt told me once that he had prayed months to the Lord to send an angel to him, but the Lord did not do it, for He had no message to send to him, for he had already learned all that was necessary for him to know, through the messages given to Joseph Smith by the angels who visited him. I do not think it wisdom for you to ask the Lord any more to send your daughter to you, for if it had been wisdom God would have granted your request long ago. With regard to the laws that govern spirits when they leave their tabernacles and go into the spirit world, they are not revealed to us but to a very limited extent. Concerning your questions to Mrs. Woodruff, I may not be able to answer all, but I will say when the spirit left the body it did not leave the room. She looked upon her body and upon those in the room. The two persons who brought in her coffin were like other persons, did not see any other persons be- sides, felt that it would have been a relief to have continued in the spirit world, but chose to return for her husband's and grandchild will be with her mother, and she will have the care of it until the resurrection. She has obeyed the celestial law and will inherit a celestial kingdom. No person who keeps a celestial law and dies and goes to the spirit world, has any desire to come back to this wicked world, and you ought to be reconciled to her departure to a better state. She is a great deal better off than those of us who remain. I got no particulars of her death, only that she died in child-bed. Both male and female have a work to perform in the spirit world, the same as in this life, according to the sphere they occupy. If there is anything left undone for your daughter, it should be done in the temple. It is your duty and the duty of all the Saints to go into a temple, when they have an opportunity, and do the work for their dead. No man knows when Christ will come. It is not revealed, the day nor the hour. I do not know whether Joseph and Hyrum will receive their bodies before Christ comes or not.  Your brother in the Gospel,  W Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City  July 28th 1884  Prest. Franklin Spencer  Dear Brother,- I have just laid before  President Taylor the questions you propounded to me, and the following are his answers. Concerning Bishop David R Stephens, of Holden Ward, had no right to rebaptize him, after he was cut off the  Church, by the counsel of F. M. Lyman, neither had  any right to confirm him, and seal upon  him all his former blessings.  He, himself, is an adulterer, and his wives are living with an adulterer.  Concerning  their being sealed to him, is a matter that must be consid- ered hereafter. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Concerning McDonald, and Mrs Lemons,- as they were  sealed in the Endowment House, she should apply, for a  hearing, before the Bishop, and his Counsellors, and, upon  their recommendation, she should have a divorce from the  same authority, who sealed them. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Conerning Christian Sorensen, who married  Caroline, she should pursue the same course, as has been  recommended for McDonald, and Mrs Lemons.  Your Brother in the Gospel W Woodruff  ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Oct. 22, 1883.  Elders Hawks.  Dear Brethren—I received your  letter of Oct. 6, 1883, also one from Brother Hinckley of Sept. 22, but I have been away  from home so much, attending conferences,  that I have not had time to answer my cor- respondence as I could wish. I also got a  letter from Brother L. Harris today, saying  that he had just returned from a mission in Trejo. They went 160 miles south of the line, as far as the  town of Oposevia. They visited the villages of Bachuchi and Compa, as he spells  it, and many other villages. Many were interested in the Book of Mormon. They  travelled through the country of the Opota Indians, who were very kind to strangers.  They wanted one of the brethren to return to them again, and they promised to do  so this winter, and thought much good could be done.  Now I want to ENDENTRY express myself to you brethren and give my  opinion and my counsel, if you will take  it. I think it does but little good to tra- vel among the Lamanites or Gentiles and  stay a few days with them and get them interested and then go and leave them. But  I think it is the duty of Brother Harris and your duty and all the missionaries who go among the Lamanites or Gentiles  that whenever you get doors open and people are interested in your teaching,  you should stop with them and teach  them the Gospel long enough for them to understand it, and if they receive it  baptize them and organize them and let some one preside over them iuntil they come to understanding. Now if Brother  Harris and the rest of the missionaries would do this, they would accomplish much more good than to travel over so much country and not stay long enough to teach them  the Gospel and baptize them. I think ENDENTRY it would be well for you three brethren to  take Brother Harris with you, and the two  Lamanites you name, and go into Sonora this winter, as your minds are  already led to do, and open a mission  among that people, and stay with them as long as you can accomplish good. If you see Brother Layton, counsel with him about it and show him these instruc- tions. Geo. Teasdale has returned from  his cherokee mission on a visit. He  has labored hard for six months and not  baptized a soul as yet, but has sown the seed. Joseph H. Felt is also sent there with Brother Dalton. We are determined to give them a fair trial, whether they  receive the Gospel or not. They are so  sectarianized and priestridden and mixed with negro and Gentile blood that we have not near the chance to convert them to the  Gospel that you have with the wild Indians in the country where you travel. I trust that you will be successful in establishing ENDENTRY branches of the Church in Sonora, and the country where you go. With regard to the news in this country, we had one of  the best conferences we have ever held. We have had a good deal of sickness in this  county. You probably know of  the death of Charles E. Robison, who was  brought home dead from the Southern States.  Brother Lewis Ro- bison, went to Montpelier to attend his buri- al. Lewis Robison has been very sick since,  nigh unto death. We buried Bishop Hun- ter on the 19th. I shall be pleased to hear from you to know how you get on in  your mission. Brothers B. Young and H. J. Grant start on Thursday, 25th.  I will forward by them certificates to  Hawks, and the two  native brethren.  Your brother in the Gospel,  W Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, June 22, 1883.  Elder James A. Melville.  Dear Brother—I wish to say that I am away from home attending conferences a good share of my time. I have been on a  mission to Manassa, Colorado, having travelled some 2000 miles in two weeks, and on my return to the office I found quite a file of letters awaiting me from different parts of the Territory. Among the number was one from you, and one of eight pages from your mother-in-law, concerning the death of your child, and Sister Gibbs asked a great many questions which she wished me to answer, and also my wife. So far as she is  concerned, she is not in very good health, and not in a situation to answer by writing, and I have not time to enter into all the particulars of her questions, but I will write to her and answer what I can. Concerning your letter and questions, I will say that it is all right with the mother and child. You  did not tell me whether the child was alive when taken from  the mother and blessed and named. I should not consider it proper to bless and name a dead child. Not that there is any ENDENTRY particular sin in it, but when a child or other person is dead we should not consider it proper to administer to it unless we were impressed with faith and power to bring it to life. I will write to  your you to deliver to her.  Your brother in the Gospel,  W Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Apl 28 1884.  Gen. J. A.

ENDENTRY Salt Lake City,  Sep't. 14th, 1884.  Dear Brother Mc.Allister:  Your letter of August 13th came  to hand just as I was leaving for the North,  and I did not have time to answer it. I  returned home last night from the North— Cache Valley, andc., and have just received eight  letters, among them yours of Sept. 3rd and  Brother Bleak's of Sep't. 5th. Your letter of  August 13th ought to have been answered be- fore but being absent is my only excuse. I  make a business of answering all letters sent  to me.  Now in reply to both of your letters. I  wish to say that your first answer to me was per- fectly satisfactory in all respects, and when it was  brought up in Council any one present who knew  about President Taylor giving you counsel to do  so ought to have named it. I am very ^glad^ myself  that President Taylor authorized you to do so, for  it takes so much labor off from me.  I now wish to say concerning the Twelve having  ENDENTRY power to seal at the Alter, that President Young called  upon all of the Quorum of the Twelve to assist in  sealing at the Alter in St George as they  had opportunity, and nearly all of them officiated  more or less, and I never knew any one of them being  set apart for that purpose. I do not think I ever was  and I have sealed many thousands. President Young  told me to set apart D. H. Cannon and any others that I needed to assist me, and I set  apart Brother Bleak for that purpose and I consider that  he is authorized to officiate in that capacity. And all that  has been done by any men authorized by Prest. Young  I consider perfectly legal, lawful and justifiable.  President Taylor is now the President of the Church and  holds the keys of the Kingdom of God on the earth. What- ever rules he sees fit to adopt in all matters of Endowments  or ordinances is all right with me and I shall endeavor  to carry out his council and adopt his rules according  to the best of my ability.  My own opinion is that Brother Bleak  is qualified to seal as he has done.

Salt Lake City, U. T. Nov 14 1887  Elder John Henry Smith,  Dear Brother:  Your favor of the 2nd inst, came duly to hand and has been perused with interest.  Brother Heber J. Sears has been released from his mission in New Zealand and money sent to pay his return passage upon the representation of his father concerning the condition of his Ephraim Williams, Mill Creek, to the attention of Bro. Teasdale. I have received no word from Bro. Edmund Richardson respecting his mission and as we cannot get work to him, nor take any action in his case by the time you ENDENTRY mention, viz. the 15th of the month, I shall await further information from there concerning him.  Of course you will see by the papers that Dyer has been put in as Receiver much to the disgust of the king who wanted Roseborough. They would have been content to have Baskin or Dickson, and it was their intention to force one of these persons in, but the two Judges were solid in favor of Dyer. The Receiver is arranging now too take possession of our places, and we are trying to get along with him as quietly as possible. There has been a good deal of excite- ment here over this question, but since the Court's action it has subsided.  I suppose you have heard from Bro. Brigham before this. He left here two weeks ago today.  So far as we know the brethren are in the enjoyment of good health. My own health is not preventing me from attending to business, but I have been suffering from a ENDENTRY severe cold which has been attended with a distressing cough, and which has kept me awake at night.  With kind regards,  Your Brother.  W. Woodruff ENDENTRY PRESIDENT'S OFFICE.  Salt Lake City, Utah, Dec. 18, 1888.  Elder John Henry Smith,  Salt Lake City,  Dear Brother: -  Our attention has been repeatedly called to the apathy and indifference of our people in regard to their political rights, while, on the other hand, our enemies were never before so well organized, so thorough and united, nor more determined in their opposition than now.  The experiences we have had in the "irrepressible conflict" between the Church and Kingdom of God and the world, from the days of Missouri; and Idaho, prove beyond doubt that the "price of liberty," to us, "is eternal vigilance." and implicit reliance upon the protection and mercy of Almighty God.  The malignant animus and the wicked purposes of our relentless foes were not more apparent in the mobbings and drivings from Missouri, or in the martyrdom of our Prophets and the expulsion of the Saints from Illinois, than they are in the infamous propositions embodied in the Edmunds and Edmunds-Tucker laws, the appointment of the Utah Commission, and other Territorial and local officers, to rule over us, the confiscation of our property, and many other ENDENTRY 2 things open to the view of all the people, which are in themselves mild and humane in comparison to measures which have been proposed to Congress for the destruction of our rights and liberty as Latter-day Saints and the subjugation of the Church of God, which have not as yet crystalized into penal statutes against us; among them the proposition to compel wives to testify against their husbands, and to make the status of polygamy, as well as the act, a crime punishable with excessive penalties; to disfranchise all Mormons, and the utter demolition of our Church organizations.  As an evidence of what would result from the falling into the hands of our enemies, of the few rights left us, we need only look to the treatment of our people in Idaho, where, so far as possible, every vestige of political rights and freedom has been denied them because of their belief in and connection with the Church.  There has been suggested to us on several occasions, by persons who think they are friends of the people, the subject of political organiza- tions in this Territory, having in view a change from the People's Party to those known as the national parties- Democrats and Republicans.  Situated as we are, we have deemed such a step to be very unwise.  When advances of this character have been made by some of our people in good faith, how have they ENDENTRY 3 been treated?  The territorial Convention of Democrats, called under the authorization of the National Democratic Committee, that met at Ogden in May, 1888, at which time and in which convention the efforts of some members of the People's Party to unite with them on Democratic principles were so shame- fully treated, and those making the efforts were grossly insulted.  It should not be forgotten that those calling themselves Republicans, Democrats and Liberals have ever and all the time united against the majority of the people of this Territory. They will even obliterate party lines for this purpose, and always and everywhere speak of our people- The People's Party- as political heretics.  Pending the time when all who love liberty and the rights of their fellow men may unite on a platform of equal justice, we urge the importance of prompt action and constant effort to strengthen the rank and file of the People's  Party, always avoiding the unwise policy of urging for office or position those who have not the confidence and respect of the people, and possibly otherwise unqualified for the suffrages of the legal voters.  The apathy and careless indifference of the people at the last election for Delegate to Congress shows the great necessity of prompt action on the part of the law abiding citizens of the Territory. ENDENTRY 4  Without multiplying words, I think it necessary that these matters should be taken in hand by the Apostles, the Presidents of Stakes, the Bishops, and all the Elders in Israel, with a view to awakening the Saints and all friends of human rights to a realizing sense of the dangers which threaten us through the negligence, carelessness and indifference of the people to the dangers which threaten them, but which may be averted, or at least postponed, "illegible their part.  For while we should always rely fully in our faith and confidence in the mercies of God, the folly of indifference, neglect of other duties or idleness must be apparent to every rational mind. It is therefore desired that the Apostles, so far as possible, will use due diligence to bringing this subject, in the wisdom and discretion of their high calling, as prominently as the spirit in wisdom dictates through them, before the Stake and Ward authorities, as also the quorum of the Priesthood and the Saints, as they visit among the people.  With kind regards,  I am, Your Brother,  W Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, March 27, 1883.  Elder John Henry Smith.  Dear Brother—Your letter of Feb. 27 arrived all safe, but I have not had time to answer before, and now I have not much news to communicate,  only that God reigns and is our friend. Congress closed and Edmunds had not had power to pass his bill, even through the Senate, against us. Geo. Q. Cannon and John T. Caine are at home with us again, in good health and feeling well. The devil, Edmunds, Van Zile, and that class of men are no better pleased with us than before. Well, I do not expect  they ever will be. I think we are having the most pleasant March we have ever seen in Utah, ploughing, sowing, and building have been going on through most of the month. The Presidency and Twelve are as well as usual. We have appointed a meeting of the Twelve for April 2nd, Monday, when we expect eight of the Twelve present, to attend to whatever business may be necessary to prepare for Conference. C. C. Rich has had another attack and is quite poorly. H. J.  Grant will not be with us at Conference. They are visiting the Laman- ites of Arizona. They have visited all the seven villages, but have not re- ported their labors to us yet. We shall keep Geo. Teasdale with us until after Conference, though he expected to get off on his mission be- fore. Our stonecutters are cutting the last course of the Temple granite to the square, which we hope to see laid on the wall the coming summer.  In your letter you referred to the counsel you wished me to give you, as your father did. Brother John Henry, I do not know what counsel I can give you. You have passed your boyhood. You have entered your manhood, with the apostleship and power of God upon your head. You strictly keep the word of wisdom, and I am confi- ENDENTRY dent you have wisdom enough to let wine and women alone. You have  learned to pray, the Holy Ghost is with you and you are acquainted with the principle of revelation, and about all the counsel I can give you is to possess your soul in patience, labor to save as many of the souls of men as you can, and remember that you were, once a boy enough to make you kind and a father to the elders and the people, and try to real- ize the great and high responsibility you are under to God and this generation in administering life and salvation to your fellow-man as an apostle of the Lamb and a witness of Jesus Chirst, and if you do this you will accomplish all for which you were born under the new and  everlasting covenant and ordained unto the apostleship, and you will follow in the footsteps of your worthy and honored father, who today is in company with the prophet Joseph, mingling with the Gods, where he can plead for his brethren who are still dwelling in the flesh, and subject to all the trials and temptations of this mortal life. Therefore hold on your way, seek to do good, labor to bring to pass righteousness and save the souls of men. Feed the flock of Christ, for you are the chief shepherd under Christ over those great nations over whom you are called to preside. Who can comprehend such a great high calling? No man, unless filled with the spirit of inspiration from God our Heavenly Father, that you and I and we all need in order to magnify our calling before God, angels, and men. My prayer is that we, with all the faithful servants of God, may possess it. While finishing my letter to you this morning, I have just received your letter to me of March 10, and am pleased to hear from you, but have nothing special new to add, only to give my love to the elders laboring with you. Your brother in the Gospel,  W. Woodruff. ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, March 27, 1883.  Elder John Henry Smith.  Dear Brother—On the 25th we received lacking numbers of the "Star," 2 copies for Jan. 15, 1883, and 3 copies for Nov. 13, 1882.  Only one copy came for March 5, 1833 1883, so that we need two more copies of that num- ber.  We are also short of 3 copies for May 23, 1881, and 1 copy for Nov. 21, 1881. If you can send them, they would complete files here.  It would be a good thing if you would send to this (Historian's) Office, for preservation here, 2 bound copies of the "Star" for each year, at the end of each volume, 2 bound copies of the "Journal  of Discourses," at the end of each volume, and 2 copies of any other Church book which may be published at the Liverpool office. These bound books could be sent per returning elders.  Your brother in the Gospel,  W Woodruff ENDENTRY PRESIDENT'S OFFICE, Salt Lake City, Utah Aug. 31, 1888. Elder John Henry Smith,  Dear Brother:  Tonto basin, Snowflake  Stake, fell into transgression before marriage.  She had received her endow- ments.  They have been rebaptized and the High Council have, by permission from me, investigated the case and consented to this; but she has not had her former blessings sealed upon her.  The woman writes in a most piteous manner to me  for this to be done that she may have the privilege of going to the House of  the Lord and being sealed to her husband.  The case is one of somewhat long  standing and deserves consideration, from the humble and penitent spirit which  the two have manifested.  I have written to her by this mail stating that when  you attend conference there you will seal upon her former blessings and  endowments.  Will you please be so kind as to attend to this and relieve  her from the distress from which she is evidently suffering.  With kind regards,  Your Brother, Wilford Woodruff ENDENTRY PRESIDENT'S OFFICE.  Salt Lake City, Utah, Dec. 4, 1888.  Elder John Henry Smith,  Manassa, Cobajos Co., Col.  Dear Brother: - It being understood that you would shortly return to this city, you and Brother John W. Taylor were appointed to-day by the Council to attend the St. George Conference, on the 16th and 17th, and the Parowan Con- ference, on the 23rd and 24th inst.  I hope this will harmonize with your other arrangements, as some important matters are pending in these Stakes which need attention.  With kind regards,  Your Brother,  W Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, March 14, 1883.  Elder L. Harris.  Dear Brother—Your letter of March 5, arrived yes- terday. Brother McDonald's letter arrived at the same time.  I also received your letter of Feby. 21, and Brother Jesse N. Smith's of Feby. 28, both of which have been read to President Taylor. Our views are that it would be best for you to  settle with the Mohaves, with those brethren who are appoin- ted to go with you, and, after you get settled, if you are needed to go to Forest Dale to visit and counsel the Indians there, or any where else, you can go and do so, but you should manage so as to get some crops in with the Mohaves, so that you all can have something to eat. Of course we do not expect the brethren to speculate out of the Lamanites, but to labor for their interest and to help them, but at the same time you will have to have a living with them. What Brother McDonald says is that Brother Jones has sent word to the surrounding tribes that the Mormons will take away their lands from them, if they live with them. That is what he has done himself, but you should show by your example that you do not go among them to rob ENDENTRY them, but to do them good. Yourself and brethren with you must set them an example worthy of imitation, by being truthful to them, remembering your prayers in the season thereof, keeping the Word of Wisdom, and using no bad language. Treat them kindly and try to improve them in their mode of life, to be clean, etc. Show them how to farm. There are a great many things they can be improved in, but example goes much further than preaching. Show them the propriety of chastity, with both men and women. Teach them the Gospel, and if they receive it baptize them and organize them into a branch or branches, and when you find the chiefs or leading men, or those whose souls are in the work, it would be well to ordain some of them elders and teach them the importance of the office and its responsibility, and labor for the Holy Spirit to guide you and the brethren with you. Would it not be  well to have your family with you in your settle- ment, that you might provide for them and make them comfortable, as far as you can? Write and  keep me acquainted how matters go along with you. My love to the brethren along with you. Your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, May 15, 1883.  Elder L. Harris.  Dear Brother  I have received your letters of April 8 and May 5, also one from Brother McDonald of April 25,  and one from Brother Bingham of April 24, all treating upon the subject of your mission to the Mohaves and your dif- ficulties with them. I have been travelling so much of  late and absent from the city, that I have not had time before to answer the letters. I was really sorry to hear of your bad luck among the Mohaves. I was in hopes that you could have made a permanent settlement among them. It was upon that ground that we gave you the fit out. It seems that the Mohaves represent that you promised to feed them, give them goods, flour, sugar, bacon, andc., and that it was upon that ground that they wanted you to settle among them. We should not have attempted to found a settle- ment among them for that purpose alone, but to teach them to cultivate the earth and to teach them the Gospel. It appears to me that you missed it in dealing out all your provisions to them in the first start, for that would deprive you of having anything to live on yourselves, but would lay a foundation for trouble in the beginning, for neither we nor you could carry on a mission of that kind, to carry provisions so far to feed a whole tribe, and if you began  to feed a few, and could not feed the whole, there would ENDENTRY be war or trouble at once, as there was as soon as you had fed out your provisions. The object of the mission was for you to go and help them raise their own food, as well  as to preach the Gospel to them. It seems that the course pursued has had a tendency to block up your way from doing anything with them. I think you should have  united in council with the brethren sent with you, and what you did should have been done by common con- sent. I was informed that you would not talk to the Indians before your counsellors, or let them know what you did say to the Indians. No Mormons ever get along in that way, but they should be united in all things. As matters now stand, I am quite at a loss to know what counsel to give you. If the Mohaves are at war with you or opposed to you, it seems to me that it would be very difficult for you to do anything with them, unless there was a reconciliation between you and them. You will have to watch the signs of the times and do the best you can. It seems that, the way you have managed the affair, you are about broken up in your outfit. As far as doors are open, we wish to establish missions among the Lamanites to preach the Gospel to them, but wisdom must be exercised in all these things. I shall write to Brother McDonald upon this subject.  Your brother in the Gospel,  W. Woodruff ENDENTRY PRESIDENT'S OFFICE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST. OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.  P. O. BOX B.

In reply to your questions would say it would be right  and proper enough for the sealing you speak of to be done if the parents of each party  wish it. It would be necessary  for endowments to be had for them before they are sealed.  With regard to what will  take place in the spirit would or at the resurrection of the dead in correcting mistakes made in this world, we know nothing except what God has revealed and there has been but little  revealed on that subject. We  ENDENTRY are informed by revelation that  those holding the keys of the  Kington and sealing power, that what they seal on earth shall  be sealed in heaven and what they bind on earth is bound in heaven and what they loose on earth is loosed in heaven. Notwithstanding this, I think that any thing that is not rightly done or any thing that should be corrected will be made right in the next world. This is about all I can say about it. I  think you are safe in doing that sealing and I should  think the parties would be satisfied with it.  Your Brother in the Gospel,  W Woodruff  ENDENTRY First Presidency relating to Charles M. Plant  OFFICE OF The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  P.O. Box. B.  Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dec. 9, 1893.  To the Presidency and High Council of  The Salt Lake Stake of Zion.  Dear Brethren:-  We have considered the appeal of Brother Chas. M. Plant from the decision of the High Council of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion wherein he makes the point that neither the Bishop's Court nor the High Council has jurisdiction in his case, for the reason, as he  alleges, that the sins of the people were forgiven at the dedication services of the Temple in this City, as then announced by President Wilford Woodruff.  Our decision is that both the High Council and the Bishop's Court have jurisdiction in a case where a charge is made of the character that has been preferred against Brother Plant.  It is true that President Woodruff did promise the people that their sins should be forgiven; but this forgiveness was not designed to extend to transgressions of so grave a character as it is charged that Brother Plant has been guilty of, unless the sins have been confessed and the law of the Lord on that subject complied with.  There is a law of the Church which requires that sins of this character must be confessed, not necessarily to the whole church, but the confession should be as widely made as the offence was known, and forgiveness should be sought for from the individuals or from that portion of the Church that is cognizant of the transgression. ENDENTRY -2-  If action had been had upon Brother Plant's case and he had been proven guilty, and had made the necessary amends, then President Woodruff's promise of forgiveness would have applied in his case.  Your Brethren in the Gospel,  Wilford Woodruff  Jos. F. Smith  First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. ENDENTRY To Alice.  My Beloved Children:  You have again the privilege of enjoying the  society of your mother. I am thankful for this. I want to give  you all a word of Council. Considering the signs of the times,  the persecution of our Nation against us, and my own age, you  cannot reasonably expect to enjoy much more of my society as your  father in this life; but you have with you your mother. Now if it  was the last testimony I was to give you on earth, I want to say  be kind to your mother. You cannot always expect to have her with  you, although she may live a score of years or more, the time will  be short. Do not give way to anger or say or do anything that  you will be sorry for, but I pray you to be united with your mother  and with each other, and act for each other’s interest. Again I  wish to say to you, my children, that I know God lives, that Jesus  Christ is the Son of God, and the Saviour of the world, and he  shed his blood to redeem us from death, and God raised up Joseph  Smith as a true Prophet of God, who brought forth the Book of Mormnon and laid the foundation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- Day-Saints, the only true and living Church upon the face of the  whole earth, with which the Lord is m well pleased; and the Church  of Christ, and the Zion and Kingdom of God has been organized on  the earth for the last time, and this Church and Kingdom of God will  stand and fill the whole earth and be thrown down no more forever.  Now you all belong to this Church and Kingdom of  God on earth, and I want you all to persue a course so as to never  be separated from the Church in time or eternity. As your father  has been called to the Apostle-ship, which office I have held near  49 years, and have now been called to stand as the President of the  Twelve Apostles.  Now as an Apostle and as your father, I have a  right to counscil you and give you advise. There is one particular  thing I want to impress upon your minds; that is, study the revelat- ions of God and have faith in them,—The Bible, Book of Mormon and  Doctrine and Covenants. And I want you all to begin in your youth to  make your wants known unto the Lord in prayer; ask him for what you  want,—not as a ceremony, but in faith, and he will hear you and  answer your prayer.  Now my children, harken to these sayings, and put  them in practice. These revelations of God are true and will be  fulfilled. I want you all to be saved and ^to^ be with me in the morning  of the first resurrection, to dwell with me forever, with God and  the Saints. This is the prayer of your loving father.

ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, July 6, 1889  President Wilford woodruff and Counselors,  Dear Brethern:  We have received a letter from the Presiding Bishop  W. B. Preston, and his Counselors in which they  quote the following excerpts, which they say they  have received from you:  "Your statement of Fast offerings and the  amount acquired to sustain the worthy poor in the  various Stakes, has been examined and returned to you:  In rebation to it we feel to say that the authorities of  Box Elder, Juab, Sanpete, Morgan Parawan and  Salt Lake Stakes may will be enquired of  to know the reason why such small amounts  have been collected from the Fast Offerings Re- lief Societies and other sources."  "We find that the amount per capita for these Stakes  is also quite large in proportion to the other Stakes.  The attention of the authorities of these Stakes should  be called to this that they may understand that they  are asking a much larger amount in proportion,  per head, than other Stakes are. There may be,  and doubtless are, good reasons in some of the  Stakes why this should be so." ENDENTRY The Presiding Bishop requests us to  "economize" on the matter of charity disburse- ments.  We have replied to the communication of the  Presiding Bishopric, and desire to say to you di- rectly that we have not not asked for any amount,  either large or small, for the poor of this Stake; that  we do not know what proportion the amount re- ceived from the Fast Offerings, Relief Societies and  other sources, bears to the other Stakes; that all  their financial transactions are conducted between  the ward Bishops and the Presiding Bishopric.  In response to the request the reports of tithings,  fast donations, etc. be made through the Presidency  of this Stake as in other portions of the Territory,  the Presiding Bishop replied: "this Stake  presents an anomaly and is not like other  Stakes"  We therefore respectfully represent that while  this condition of affairs continues, we are unable  to "economize" or do anything in regard to this  matter, except urge upon the Saints as we have  done in the past, to pay their tithes and offerings  faithfully and contribute liberally to every ENDENTRY financial requirement of the Churchs  Very Respectfully,  Your Brethern,  Angus M. Cannon  Presidency of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion.  ENDENTRY Salt Lake City  February 6th 1889  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother:-  At a meeting of the High  Council of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion, held in this city,  on Thursday, Jan. 31st, 1889, the subject of the compen- sation for labor performed by the Clerk of said Council  of the Stake was considered.  It was expressed by resolution as the unanimous opin ion of the Council that the Clerk ought to be paid from the  General tithing fund, for the following, among other reasons:  1st.  This is the largest and most important Sake of the  Church, the Clerk is exclusively engaged in performing  public service in the interest of the people, and so long as he  is thus engaged has no other source of support.  2nd:  As the tithes of this Stake are paid directly into  the General Tithing Store, there is no other source than the  fund that can be drawn upon for the payment of a Clerk. In this respect the situation is different to what it is in  other Stakes where the business of High Councils is com- paratively limited and Clerks canj occupy much of their  time in handling tithes and performing other duties  ENDENTRY 3rd  As other officers are being compensated from the  tithes fund for services performed, it does not appear to the  Council to be in accord with equity to exclude from this rule  a clerk who is necessarily and exclusively engaged in the  public service.  4th  If the Clerk of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion and  of its High Council be not paid from the general tithing  fund it will become necessary to appeal to the Bishops  and through them to the people, for means to meet this neces- sary demand.  The Council are unanimously of the opinion that such  a step would have a very discouraging effect.  It would,  in the present condition of public sentiment especially, be  more than likely to diminish the amount of tithing paid  as the Saints feel, whether properly or otherwise, that their ob- ligations are already about all they can stand.  Under  these circumstances, and considering what its effects  would in all probability be, the Council believe that an  appeal to the people for the payment of the Clerk would  be a financial injury to the Church instead of a mea- sure of economy.  The Church would lose many  times the amount involved in the paying of the salary  for the Clerk.  On account of the brethern of the High Council and himself  entertaining this view, the President of the Stake refrained from  ENDENTRY 219 bringing this subject before the Priesthood meeting, lest it  might have the effect of depreciating de^pleting^ the Church revenue, especially at this season when the people are engaged in  settling their tithing accounts.  The undersigned were appointed by the High Council  a committee to present this matter to you, and as the subject is urgent  owing to the position in which the Clerk would be placed  by delay we respectfully request that a response be given at your earliest convenience.

Please find enclosed a letter from Bp. E. Holman to  the High Council which explains itself  Brother Joseph Shaw appeared before the Council Nov. 20th in answer to a summons, to show cause why the  action of the Bishops Court should not be sustained  and he be cut off from the Church.  He affirmed  the correctness of the Bishops report and made further  explanations, as follows,  That his wife whom he married about twelve  years ago was some eight years his senior in age, he  being now in his fortieth.)  that she was the mother  of three daughters by a former marriage, who were  now married and had children of their own, that  he had no children by his wife; that Sister Hazeltine,  now twenty six years old, was an intimate friend of the  family, that four years ago he made overtures of  illegible age to her; that his wife was ^both^ agreeable and  ENDENTRY anxious for him to have her, but her father objected  solely on the ground of the law against such mar- riages.  And that in an unguarded moment the illegible was committed.  The spirit of humility and repentance which  Bro. Shaw manifested was so marked that it re sulted in the resolution by the High Council to  have me submit the case to you; and to ask if  any mercy could be shown to him.  If so, to what  extent?  As the Council felt they had no discretion  ary power in such cases, and could only present  the facts and leave the matter with you to determine  Please return Bp Holmans letter as it is neces sary that we file it for reference in this case.  With feelings of kind regards, I am your brother in the Gospel Joseph E. Taylor ENDENTRY Salt Lake City,  Dec. 23, 1880.  David John,  Dear Brother—  I write to say that Bishop Udell,  of St. John, Arrizona has been with me, and  something has got to be done to secure that place, or we shall loose it. The Trustee in Trust has loaned Brother Udell 270 cows to meet the meat pay- ment in May. But we must have men to go there  as early as possible, to take possession of the land and water, in the Spring, in order to controll it.  President Taylor has laid it upon me to call for the men in the various Stakes and have them pre- pare themselves to go this winter or early in the  spring. Some ought to go this winter. Bro. Smoot was appointed last year to gather up a company  from Utah Stake to go there, but there was nothing done about it. We called for 30 families at Ogden conference, last Sunday, and we want 30 families  from Utah Stake. We must have some 200 fam- ilies to go there to take possession of that place.  Many were called last year but few went. And those  ENDENTRY that did go, most of them went everywhere else except  where they were called to go.  Now Brother John we want you to take this matter in hand and call 30 families in your Stake to go on this mission. We do not want them to  go anywhere else St. John. It is as good a  place as any spot our people have settled, and the county seal of the Apache County. It would be well  for you to call for volunteers; but if you do not get  men enough that way, call them. Call upon the Bishops of the Stake to assist you in this matter, and let me know how you succeed.  Your Brother in the Gospel,  W.

With kiind regards,  Your Brother, Wilford Woodruff  ENDENTRY Laie Oahu April 16th/ 91  Prest W Woodruff,  Dear Brother -  We forward to you the  Anual Financial report of the Hawaiian Mission and  Laie Plantation for the year ending March 31st, You will notice there are some reductions made in the  value of personal property, This is not done because  of changes in the Market values but because in our  judgement former valuations were too high, I had  several of the brethren act as a committee to appraise the livestock, Ive quoted the prices they place upon them, I think the houses as a whole are valued a little low, the stock cattle which includes in the count all of the  calves are very inferior and are reduced in price from ten (10) to (8) dollars and I think it should have been to  seven (7) per head.  The oxen formerly quoted at seven- ty, we now quoted at sixty,  I think fifty (50) would  have ^been^ nearer correct, carriage, Brake, Houses and  double trees are new and quoted a little less than Cost.  Value of yokes and chains are reduced to three  dollars each.  One new plow, and one new barrow are  reported.  Price placed upon land ^etc^ accord with report of  1889.  We built a stable valued at one hundred dollars,  There are no changes made in value of Mill and  ENDENTRY 2 machinery, my judgement is it should be reduced  from twenty to twelve thousand dollars, Rind shed  to one thousand,  Growing cane is looking very well but we are having very little rain, which is against us, We are using all the water we can that accumulatess  from showers in the mountains and flows down to us, Our oxen are very poor from constant work.  Will I think only be able to bring sufficient wood from the mountains  for the next season sugar making.  We have made a new road into one of the canyons at considerable cost  and are hauling wood, three loads per day,  We are for- tunate in having the mules I purchased last summer  to do our plowing for this summers planting,  They and the  horses we can work in will I think do the work in this line  Of the unit noted in Profit and Loss, as board etc, at  Mission House, two hundred and thirty seven (237 50/100) dollars was spent for stove, dishes, towels, bedding, new  matting for the rooms in all of the houses etc,  When I  took charge here all of these things were completely worn  out, I have refered to carriage and Brake, we were oblige  to have them to make frequent trips to Honolulu, With reference to "food, we have set a better table than  we did the  during 1889 but not good enough to satisfy  several who are here, we will endeavor to curtail  expenses the present year as much as possible - ENDENTRY 3 There are six families here with from one to three  children each, all eat at one table and meet in one  room for prayer and family meetings,  We have just  painted the out side of the Meeting house and gave the  fence surrounding it a coat of white wash.  Sugar has taken a sudden fall in price, we hope it  will improve,  I was lucky we had all of ours in  the Market and sold early,  I would be pleased  to receive from you any suggestions, counsel,  or instructions you may have for me -  The Utah Elders here will soon all be away in their fields of  labor, some have gone,  The Clerk of the Mission  will forward a report of our Conference by this mail, Ever wishing you and your counselors prosperty and  Gods blessings, I am your brother in ^The^ Gospel Covenant,  W, E, Pack ENDENTRY Laie Oahu Aug 20th 1890  Prest W. Woodruff  Dear Brother,  I feel it a duty and a pleasure to write you from time to time that you may know of our your condition and prospects in this Mission – The Brethren who are traveling and preaching seem to feel encouraged in their labors, still, like their forefathers this is a back sliding people and it requires much patience and labor to keep to keep those who have received the Gospel near the line of their duty. So we some times trouble them in a small degree we can appreciate the efforts and anxiety of our older and more experienced brethren who are constantly laboring to direct the Saints in the path of duty – In the raimis Conference of the Mission there are those who are accepting the Gospel and there are those who are falling away. All together however we feel that the interests of the plantation are being looked after as well as the circumstances will permit. We have been bothered considerable to procure a sufficient number of laborers to carry on the work as we would like – the people have been bothered by sickness the four months hereto just and many who are here are old men, and old women, old saints, kind of pensioners who cannot perform much labor – There is not enough able bodied saints here to do the work of the plantation as it should be done – If we had twenty five additional able bodied men it would be to work it ENDENTRY advantage – we will do what we can to encourage to ^the^ Saints to gather here – So far we are having an exceptional runing season – This means good cane and a plenty of weeds – We have just planted twenty five acres of cane, Are constantly cultivating and will plant all the we can and not neglect the growing crop – In our judgment the acreage of cane should be increased – If there is a profit on ten acres of cane over  the cost of its production, there would be double the amount on twenty acres. The rattoon cane is very late – It is impossible now to determine whether it will be sufficiently matured to work into sugar the comeing winter or not – Am being delayed during the months of Jany and Feby has proved a great loss to this seasons crop of rattoon – During those months we were procurring and putting in  place a new boiler – In consequence of the strible where the cane was taken off not proving as good as was anticipated, The present rattoon is seven (7) acres less than reported by Prest King in his annual report, On the 10th of May we received returns for the last sugar made and shiped during his presidency here amounting to four thousand, one hundred, and one, and 79/100 dollars  ($4101 79/100). Taking this amt from thirteen thousand five hundred and seventy one, and 30/100 dollars (13,571 30/100) ^the amt we owed when he sailed^ leaves a balance of nine thousand four hundred, and sixty nine and 51/100 dollars (9469 51/100) the amount we owed G. T. Waterhouse on the 12th day of May – I do not know ^just^ how our debt stands at this date, we are now expecting returns for sugar shiped some time since. We will do all we can to control expenses where there is ENDENTRY no profits to be derived. During the next week we expect to be cutting cane on our contract with the Kahuku Sugar Co – This mite interfere with our plowing and planting cons- iderably but we will keep on plowing as much as posible. The land here has to be plowed twice before planting the cane so it is a slow and tedious process of preparing land.  With much regret I have now to refer to the condition of Elder Chas Harper, our black Smith and assistant engineer, for some time past his health has been quite poor and of late he seems to have a renewal of an old trouble brought upon him by being runover by a wagon loaded with wood – Should he not recover soon I feel it would not be wise to retain him here as he is not now able to perform his usual labors. He is a faith- ful, interested, and industrous worker and yard Elder and should it prove necessary for him to leave ^us^ soon we shall regret it very much. If he remains he is not able to take charge of the Mill Machinery. It will therefore be necessary before we commence again in December to make sugar to have some one to here who can attend to the machinery, and do our black smithery,  Bro Isaac Fax, who has been in charge of the engine and machinery came here ^up^on this his second mission without his family with the understanding that his would ^be^ a short mission – It will be two years in Jany since he arrived here. He has some impressions that he would be released this fall – He has a wife and three small children at home – They are living in a house not their own. ENDENTRY We cannot spare him this fall unless some one comes to take his place – A person who can do common black smithing and who renders lands running and taking care of Machinery would be the most proper one to send. We also need two more young men to travel amongst the people and preach to them. Bros Johnson, are the only ones here who can be spared for this plus who can speak with any degree of proficiency in the language of this people. Bros Heaurt mond and How, are studying hard trying to master the language, but it seems a difficult matter for them. The health of the Utah Missionaries here is good with exception of Bro Charles Harper. I fear it will be neces- sary for him to return by the next vessel that sails, It will sail on the 29th instant.  With deference I am your brother and colaborer in the Gospel covenant.  Ward E.

Woodruff Dear Brother-  I regret that it has become  necessary for me to write you of a matter that during a  year and seven month past has been a matter of serious  thought and much concern to me,  In the month of September  1889 the young lady, who came to the islands when I did  became sick of Asthma, her sickness increased until it was thought she would have to return home, She was very resolute  and determined to remain and fullfil the mission ass- -igned her, We took her to Honolulu ^in Feby^ thinking the change might  benefit her.  She improved and returned here and recovered  sufficiently to be able with difficulty to do her part of the kitchen  work and household duties up to December 1890. Since then she  appeared to be near dieing.  She has passed a part of many, many, nights in her chair inhaling vapors to aid her respiration, Her sickness has worn upon her until she is  now very thin, and week.  We have thought that the  summer months might bring her relief, We still hope  for this.  Our experience of the two last winters, witness to us  that it would ^be^ very unwise for her to attempt ^to pass^ an other  winter here, We think also that she would be taking great  risks in returning in the cold fall months, It would  seem that she should return while the weather in Utah, ENDENTRY 2 is warm so she might become acclimate before winter sets in.  While upon the sea comeing here she suffered seve- rely from seasickness, the Ship's doctor and Stewardes expressed their doubts several times of her surviving to  reach land.  Towards the last of the voyage she had a  number of sinking spells,  On reaching Honolulu she was  carried off from the vessel in a state of unconsciousness. I doubt whether she would have survived and other twen- ty four hours upon the water,  We hope better things for her  when she shall return home - unless she improves in  health she will be in bad condition to cross the water with a  helpless charge to care for,  We think she should have a male  attemdant to accompany her who might if it should be thought  ^necessary^ return again to the islands,  On her arrival in Utah it will  be necessary that a place of refuge be provided for her for  a little time,  please write me on receipt of this what you  advise to be done with reference to her -  You no doubt remember my misfortune in loosing  my hand and arm to near the elbo joint,  I have many  times thought to wwrite you (but through a feeliing of delicacy) I have defered doing so to the present time) to ask you  if you feel that this plantation can offer me the  benefits of an artificial arm, I suppose it would  cost from fifty to sixty dollars, The traveling Elders have  gone to their fields of labor.  All here are in good health except  the one above refered to. My kind regards to ^you^ and your counselors. W. E. Pack  ENDENTRY Ward E Pack 8 May 1890 Honolulu etc, etc, Mat 8th/90 Prest W. Woodruff Dear Brother  The the letter sent me by the Presidency  of the Church appointing me to take the presidency of this Mission  came duly to hand,  also one with instructions to Prest King. With reference to myself I will say that I will endeavor to prove worthy  of the confidence imposed in me.  From past experience in this  mission I have ample reason in anticipating the labors this great  responsibility will place upon me.  The character of the natives will  be no new study to me having passed two missions amongst them  previous to the present one, I have also had considerable exper- ience in sugar plantation life which I trust will be of benefit to  me while I am here.  Pres. King has turned over to me the  books of the Mission and the charge of Laie and will tomorow  fully resign to me the presidency of all matters pertaining to the  mission as he expects to embark upon the California  and thence to Utah with some thirtyseven islanders as company- -ing him from this Mission. We are now making sugar and  will want to work as fast as consistant with the weather. We have  reason for some dubiety with reference to being able to procure  as many laborers upon the plantation as we would like and  the nature of the work to be done will require but will try to  obviate all trouble in this direction.  Our work cattle are extrem- -ely poor this will be quite an obstacle in the way to putting in the  number of acres of cane that rightfully should be planted this  season. ENDENTRY I wish to call your attention to an agreement for right of way  for a rail road to be built by Kahuku plantation Co through  King and one  Mr Young I was instructed by prest King in his abscence under  certain special conditions for not less the one hundred and twenty  dollars per annum to enter into a verbal agreement with Mr Young  who represented the Kahuku plantation for the right of way  for said Rail Road.  The conditions made between me and Young  were that said road should enter Laie on its west line at a  point about two hundred yards east of the public road and to  runn thence near to and along the sea shore to the west point  of Lanilou - thence bearing left to and along the beach upon the  high or sandy land to the harbor near Laiewalos, where they were  to have not excede one and one half acres of land for warehouses  ground, wharf, water frontage for landing, lumber etc and rail road switches.  A wharf was to be built by them which with the  water frontage was to be used in common by the Kahuku Planta and Laie.  They were only to build a single back road and  were in no way to dispose of or contribute the franchise procured  from Laie to any other road or company.  They were to  pay one hundred and fifty (150) dollars per annum in Semi- annual payments of 75 each.  We were to have the privileg of lay- -ing a switch from our warehouse to and join in their track  to be ever free of charge for shipping freight to and from the boat  landing to warehouse.  The franchise to them to continue for the  term of Twenty years from the date thereof.  Wm Young was to  ENDENTRY have the agreement drawn up in Honolulu and to forward  it to King for his and the Elders approval.  It  did not however reach Laie  the agreement drawn and  signed in Honolulu by Prest King and the parties on behalf  of said Kaluku Company will be submitted to you for  your approval - I thought it advisable to write you that  you might know the conditions which said agreement should  have been drawn to cover,  You notice whether the conditions here  stated can be taken advantage of under the written agreement,  There is a little land that might be used for raising  rice if used by Chinamen,  Is it advvisable to lease it for a term  of years,  If so have I the authority to act in the matter,  Please  write me respecting this and all matters of interest to the  mission giving such instructions to govern my acts as you  deem proper that I may act advisably and in accord  with your counsels and that of my brethren of the mission. The Utah Elders excepting the Johnsons who will soon be there are  now in their fields of labors and the native Elders are most of  them gone to their respective fields.  The prospects for preaching  the Gospel to this people seem to be as good as usual.  There  is quite a good number being added to the Church from Confer- -ence to conference.  I will write you more fully soon, With Kind regrds to Bros G.Q. Cannon and yourself  I am your brother in The Gospel  W E. Pack ENDENTRY Aug 1/89 Pres.

Not having any having particular  news or Business requiring me to write I have defered  writing till now-  Our General Concerence commenced on  the 6th and ^closed^ on the 9th ^inst^  It was very well attended through not  as largely as on some previous occasions of this kind  which was owing to great attendance in the Honolulu one March 31 and April 1st at whitch ^time^ we had intended to have  dedicated our new Meetinghouse, but not being able to get the painting all done and the fence in front ^also^ we put off the  dedication till the 29th Inst We ^however^ held meetings with a crowded house - a great many not being able to gain admisttance We had a native feast on Saturday  there were many ^hundred in^ in atten- -dance.  it took ten hogs - one Beef and etc  It was intended  to have made the feast a source of revenue for the benefit of  ENDENTRY the meeting house But instead I think the committee came  out behind $2500 But through members of the Church belonging  to Club ^associations^ of Honolulu - gave us a free concert on Saturday evening March 31st by which we cleared $8300.  The house will seat  between three and four hundred.  As there are some more  outlays on the building I cannot give you a statement  of the cost of the building at present, But expect to have it prepared  at the dedication April 29th  The Statistical report of the mission gives our  present numbers as follows - Elders 366 Priests 153 - Teachers 15 Deacens 83 Members Males 1199 Females 1693 Total of officers and  members 3609  Children Blessed 119 total 3728  Baptized during the last six months 283  Rebaptized 21  Deaths 32 in giving  the totals of Souls there are all the children that are blessed  till they are baptized are not numbered and are lost  till they are eight yeas old and are Baptized which  would number about 600 more Making a grand total  of Souls belonging to the Church of 4328, or there abouts  as I have been looking over the Children blessed for four years  past.  We called Sixteen Native Elders to labor as Missionaries six to the Island of Hawaii four to the Islands of Maui Molokai and Lanai four on the Island of Oahu two to the Island of Kauai.  Enoch Farr Jr. will preside ove Matthew Noall over Oahu E Barrell ENDENTRY over the half of Hawaii and J. F. Gates the other  half of the Island  Elders  This dispaces of all the Utah  Elders except Bro Edwin Davis and P Madsen the  latter we released to return home.  Bro Davis is our  Enfincer - Elders Gates Beasley will not  be able to travel much - they will make a trip each  to their fields and regulate the branches and where  necessary to ordain a few to preside over Branches as we have reserved that right to the home Elders as the  Native Elders have no discretion in these matters The Sixteen Elders just called responded cheerfuly and I  may ^say^ enthusiasticaly to go to their several fields of labor - There were thirteen Native Elders out the last term all seem to have acquit themselves honorably (So far as we are able  to judge) and seem to be in position of a good Spirit.  As regards our temporal labors - I believe they  are going on all right the crops are growing and look- -ing well and if the Lord blesses us with rains in due Season  we will have a fine crop of cane to come off this coming  Season commencing in August or first Sept next. The Butcher Shop we started in Honolulu has not met  my expectation.  But there were a surpluss of cattle on the  land and I see no other way to dispose of them as all  the Butchers on Honolulu were supplying their markets  with Beef from their ^own^ extensive herds.  The Beef we  ENDENTRY are marketing are small runing from 250 to  350 ^lbs each^ and not very fat.  They are netting ^us^ about $1500 only per head.  Still that is more than I could Sell them  for if I could Sell them at all  Enclosed please find our yearly exhibit of  our Finantial condition it is not as flattering as I could wish  but considering the notes at the bottom showing the one estimate of  illegible  ^(as estimated and charged it one But fell short in the amount)^ will make my account show a little more favorable A little help will be very thankfuly received.  We expect Bro  Samoa.  Through Bro Deans  labors we have been able to lay before the Natives a Small  pamphlet of 54 pages (We mailed you a few coppies) they  are Sought after by the Saints and will be read by all of  them and I am Sure will do much good.  With love to yourself and the Brethren of the  office as associated with you  I remain your Brother in the Gospel Wm King ENDENTRY Honolulu Hawaiian Islands April 10th 1890  President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City Utah  Dear Brother I will endeaver to give  you a few items regarding our labors and doing of  late. We held our usual half yearly Conference commencing  April 4th closing April 6th. There was a gooldly  representation from all the Islands. ^A great^ many men women  and children coming on foot all the way from Honolulu  to babe of two months  old in her arms almost the whole distance slowing  one sister was so unaccustomed to walk she was  sore footed it was with difficulty she could hobble  up to the stand when she was called upon to represent  the Society of which she precided over I could not  help but shed tears of joy for the many many testimo- nies that they were able to bear and the outpourings  of the spirit of the Lord up on them. Our Baptisms  were not quite as many as our last term encluing  Sept 31st 1889 the statistical account I will  forward as soon as we make some corrections it is a very hard two get a correct report through our ENDENTRY Native Elders but in the future we will be able to  do a little better as there will be white Elders  to travel and regulate and assist in making our  reports that is to see that Branch is provided with  books for the purpose so that a uniform report may be had  we are gradualy increasing our force of Native Elders in the  missionary field. we called 22 ^Elders^ for this term all respondting  to the call with chee^r^fulness. Be Elder Joseph G Fueger who was Baptized by Elder Nuall was called one  year ago to take the school. I consider he has done well  for a new beginer. He has an honorable release to  gather to Zion he will sale by tomorrow’s Steamer.  I had expected also to have been one to be released  and felt very much disappointed that I did not receive  any word to that affect. It is not myself that I am anxious  about but my Family at home. I have some concern about  my Boys need some restrictions upon them that only a Father  can wield, though I cannot say that Fathers are always able  to keep their Boys within bounds. But I feel that the mission  will not suffer by my release, as Bro W C Pack is  a man of experience and judgment as regards the finances I consider they are improving and in a fair  way for a total liquidation of our indebtedness to Mr. Waterhouse  March 31st 1890 our total debt to Mr. Waterhouse was  ENDENTRY $11,70000 we have decreased that amount by today payment  of hauling for the Kahuku Sugar Plantation of some $1250  and cash from other sources $58000. We have also shiped  fifty Tons of sugar lacking 750 lbs according to present  price will net us 5¢ per lb or nearly so the proceeds  of which will agregate some where from 470000 to $500000  subtracting from the above amt would leave at Mr. W.  a balance of ^indebtedness to Mr. Wh^ 517000 it may fall short a little of  this estimate we still have over 100 Tons yet to  come off the new boiler grate and other repairs were ^all^ paid for before March 31st We have a few unpaid  accounts of small amounts of money on deposits  as regard our improvements in the mill of new  Boiler and grate I want to say it is a success We started up March 3d but owing to stormy weather we could not do our fair work but the weather subsequen- tly got better and we got in fourteen days run  befor our Conference making about 51 Tons of sugar  of a superior quality to any previously made making an  average of 7285 lbs per days run with a very little more  improvements the we can do away with one fire and  be able to make an average of four Tons per days run  all with the one boiler. Our yearly statement will be  forwarded as soon as we get it completed.

I am pleased to state that we are all in the  enjoyment of good health.  Our Semianual Conference  adjourned on the 7th of Oct having begun on the 5th We had an unusualy large number of representatives  from the other Islands and Honolulu consequently  a very interesting time  one of our most interesting  meeting was our Sunday School exhibition which  lasted three hours there were two prizes for to be  given to the two best schools there were four schools  competing. The first prize was an enlarged painting  picture of President Enoch Farr Jr which was awarded to the Laie Sunday School the second a map of South America representing  the Nephites landing and many of their cities awarded  ENDENTRY to the Kaneoke Sunday School.  The exhibition went of so- well.  We will hold a general Sunday ^School^ Union and  exhibition of all the Sunday Schools of all the Islands as as many of them as can attend ^at our April Conference^.  In addition the  Relief Society got up a fair and exhibited some  very nice work which our Sisters have labored to learn  our Hawaian Sisters to crochet. lace knit stockine and  shoulder shawls lamp mats apr make aprons Chldrens dress quilts Bead spreads and many other articles to  many to mention all of which were very  attractive to the Visitors all the articles were sold very readily.

There has been three new meeting houses built during  the last term considering the poverty of the people I consider they  have done well. and Spiritualy the work is very incouraging ENDENTRY Bro Eakel arrived October 1st  in good spirits he seems to be on hand for anything we think of  sending ^him^ off to the Island Kauai to study the Language  as it will ^be^ imposable for him to be very useful without  it  I think he will make a good one for Book Keeper  and Store Keepers.  He undoubtedly is a g^ood^ school teacher also, but if we had a little musick combined with the school teacher it would be much better.  Bro Enoch Farr Jr was honorably released, and will sail on or about the 21 inst. Our new selections of missionaries for this coming term respond^ed^ cheerfully, to the call and  will be off soon for their several fields of labor.  Bro J. H.

We have not made a thorough exhamination of the of the old Boiler But in apperance it looks as  though it might be repaired and placed at the end of the new Boiler and be a great saving of fuel besides increasing our capacity if sugar making. On Thursday Feb 27th we had our new Boiler and Grate and the repairs all in order and put on the steam to see if all was was  right. But as we had not every thing els and being in the middle of the week we did not start up grinding till Monday Feb March 3d every thing was satisfactory but little exhertion on the part of the firemen is required to keep up the steam and will burn fuel that the old grate would would smuther up and go out the new Boiler sets a little over two feet higher than the old one and  the repairs we have put on the pumps and other parts of the machinery to save the steam we find that we can do as much work of not more now with 70 lbs of steam ENDENTRY than before with 80 lbs of steam so much for the improvements But ^we^ find some other draw backs. The weather continues very stormy we run Monday and Tuesday till swin and was obliged to shut down for rain which was a regular pour down flooding the whole country for five days But faired up a little and we started up again Monday 10th and got in two days run but it rained all last night so we are layed off again and still it rains the whole country is full of rain and the land is so saturated with water it is almost impasable to get a cart on the land without entirely destroying the old stools our rattoons will be almost a failure unless the weather should settle still there are many things that might be worse we have got the cane and  men and machinery to take it off and manuafacturye into sugar enough I think to square all of our indeptedness.  The cost of our new Boiler and improved grate $250000 2000 fire Brick $11000 3.000 Reg Brick $6600 13 Bbls of cement $84.50 14 Bbls of lime $4900 a new steam gague $1500 a Machineist 19 days at $900 per day $17100 1 Brick maun at $700 $133.00 168 day of of common labor $12800 Repaire on pumps etc $22400 a new wire wire cloth for centrifical $12.80 making a total of $3.493.30 there is the freight of Boiler and brick not at added we not having received the Bills of them yet. during our lay off we have been favored with team work for the Kahuku Plantation Yar ENDENTRY hauling lumber and parts machinery andc amounting to $136200 our current expenses for labor for January and February save about $1.00000 so we have a little balance in our favor and the returns for the sugar we made in December and ship Jan 9th was $3673.23 so we are not fra from where we were Dec 31st 1889 as per quarterly account rendered from Mr Waterhouse showed our indebetedness to be $1137500 at that date, all of our new  plant cane is growing finely and looks prousperous The long  and continued wet weather works a hardship upon many of our Natives here who are depending on their work for a living as well as those intending to emmigrate to join this Spring The Elders and Sisters of the Mission are all enjoying good health except Sister Pack. who has been troubled with the asthma and has been removed to Honolulu hoping to get some  relief there. I hear She is some better. Some of our Native Elders have returned from their Missions reminding me that April will soon be here But I have had no intim- ation from you of my release further ^than^ what was said last July wishing me to remain over till the next crop was taken off which is supposed to be of by April. But through the putting in of the new Boiler and rainy weather the crop will not be off iss or by April, I must confess I was a little disappointed the last mail in not getting any word about my release one way of the other as Conference ENDENTRY is so near bye I would liked to have left here in April but as the Honolulu April 11th it would be almost imposable for me to be ready by that time and get all the Natives ready with passports and tickets and other matter properly arranged so I have concluded to arrange matters to sale sail per Australia May 8th unless you should change the Programme. We will have another mail on the 14th inst by which I hope to hear again from you in answer to matters concerning a School Teacher. as  Elder Fu^e^gar will the present School Teacher will be released to return to Zion among the Natives that expect to accompany me Kakauoha and a part of his family perhaps Kissimaka- lehua they are two good and influential men I think they will have the affect upon those already there towards keeping them in the right way. there ^are^ some others Kanekopu and George Rtero Prest Smith will be acquainted with these men. There are some other matter I might write about but as  Conference is so near in which a Statistical and financial acct – of the Mission will be forwarded I will forbare saying anything further at present I would be kindly remembered to Prest Cannon and Smith, Praying the Lord to Bless and strengthen you I Remain your Brother in the Gospel of Peace.  Wm King ENDENTRY Laie Hawaiian Islands June 15th 1889 President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City  Dear Brother  Your very welcome and interesting  letter of May 27th was duly received and cont- ence noted.  As regards my release I am  perfectly satisfied to abide by your wishes I have no  other desire than to labor where I can be of the  most service, and with the blessings of the Lord  we will be enable to pay off all our indebetedness  with the next crop which will truly be a great satis- -faction to us all.  I wrote you June 5th in which  I refered again to my release one reason for my  being a little anxious about it was from a  letter from my Wife saying they were a little short of  funds, my property not being in a shape that they could  help themselves very much therefrom.  But that is all  right I trust the way will open for them to relieve their  necessities.

We have received our Missionary help dividing some of the district. as they were to learg at present thre is a great waking up among our Native Saints.

Since the completion of our new Meeting house in Honolulu the Branch has grown wonderfully from 500 to 1000 being the number at present.

The Boiler did not stand the test bursting one of the  tubes found them all to thin and unsafe.  hence, in the midst of our grinding will now be obliged to wait  for a new boiler to be made which ^will^ delay us four weeks longer we now having lost one week.  We could get the old boiler retubed in one week or ten days less time  provided the shell of the boiler proved upon exhamination  to be fit or strong enough.  but it would take four or  five days more to find that out and then be left right  where we are now, and if considered fit it would be  an old boiler at last.  So to make sure we are all  unanimous in having a new boiler we have so ordered  ENDENTRY and work was began this afternoon.  The cost will be  $250000 with an improved grate which will be a great improve- -ment on the old and will give us greater results and  I am in hopes to bet be able to increase the number of hun- -dreds of pounds per day.  We run in the last month  19 days and parts of day-  making al 43 and a half tons which is away below any everag of our former work  caused by the defective working of our machinery. We have here ready for shipping the 43 Tons and over  which will be shiped Jan 17 per Australia.  200 boxes of  100lbs each making Ten Tons will be forwarded to  Thos Webber Z.C.M.I. as ordered by President Geo Q. Cannon.  The sugar is not as good as I would have  liked and as good as we have made under more favorable  circumstanses But it is the very best we could do with  our machinery which we will try and improve before starting  up again.  I did not think it prastable to send any syrup by  this shipment as the syrup is realy not fit for family use The first molasses from the No 1 sugar would grain up in the  keep the no 2 contaimes most to much lime and has to  be thined up some with steam in order to pump it out  of the tank.  if you could see it I am sure you would not  want it. - I very much regret this delay in the taking  off this crop as I was straining every nerve to get off the   ENDENTRY crop and square off our acc't at Mr. Waterhouses  and make good my word which I am sanquine  would have been done had the same success attended. The run as former I think we have upon a safe  colculation 170 Tones yet to come off and I am inhopes  200 Tons.  We have made five Tons to the acre off from 7 acres and we have 14 more acres of just such cane I have another matter regarding the cultivation of the cane  and the manufacturing it into sugar.  That is this Mr. ^Young^ as Principle in a big sugar Co- have leased the Kakula  and Maiele Kahana ranches and are a going to put up  a first-class sugar mill. 2 miles from us and want  the right of way ^for a rail road^ across our land to our landing with the  privilige of errecting a ware house and wharf   This last  item will grately improve the shipping of our sugar as the ware -house will join ours - They also propose to mill all the  cane that can be grown upon our land extending portable rail  roads into the cainfield which can be hauled to the mainline  by a horse - But there is the sequil they will only give us 9/16 theywe cut and load it in the cars-  They deliver it ^in sugar^ on board of  the Steamer - We of course pay the shipping after it leaves port  Some mills are giving the planter more and some are taking the  9/16 so I am informed.  I mearly throw out these propositions to get  a few pointers from you to guide our actions as regard the  ENDENTRY the above proposition we are not favorably disposed towards it but there is one thing to be considered we are wasting to much Sugar in this old mill to continue to run it as it is only a question of time when our wood supply will be exhausted I do not propose in this letter to get any deffinite answer to  these questions as it will be imposable for one to lay before you facts and figures for you to  a reply but merely to shrow show you our position andc and get a few sugestions  this Sugar Company wants to buy all of our cotton crop next August and Sept for Sud cane. if so it will leave only the plant cane remaining to grind of 47 or 48  acres which if continue to improve as ^it^ now looks will make from 4 to 4 tons to the acre. So much for the sugar and Cane now I will come to the spiritual part of  the Mission which is still prosperous but I do not think we are making as many converts this time as the the  two last ^time^ but enough to show that the work is increasing.  the last Elders Charles Narper J.J.

Bro Harper is at Laie doing the Blacksmithing I wanted him to take the engineering and liberate Bro Fot to  travel among the nations But he did not feel like he was capable to perform that work.  ENDENTRY In justice to Bro Fugar a new convert who wishes to gather to Zion having or will have served as a missionary one year next April in school teaching and three months in laboring on the plantation I feel that he should be released at our next April Conference. The question is who will fill his place as a teacher. If either of the Elders who came last were qualified we would be all right but they could not pass an exhamination entiteling either of them to a certifficate of qualification as a teacher. Elder Wm Allen might pass muster But he has Just mastered the language  and he is very much needed in the missionary  field. Besides it is not necessary for a school teacher to understand the Hawaiian language a teacher should be in the school some little time before taking the school as the method of teaching the Hawaiian children the English language is somewhat different from English speaking Children I hope you may be able to Send us a teacher by the first of March.

Dear Brother,  In conformity with the resolution of the General Board,  that it should be my duty to visit the church schools as  much as occasion should require, and in compliance  with your special instructions, I made positive appoint- ments for the Stake Academies at Coalville, and  Morgan, intending to make the time of my further appoint- ments ahead depending upon the amount of work that  should require my attention at the aforesaid places.

The e- vening meeting was, by the courtesy of President Hatch, divi- ded between Sister, Lucy B. Young and some other ladies in the  interest of the "Woman’s Journal," and myself. Time enough,  however, was left me after these ladies to lay the interest of  their youth in general and of their Stake Academy in par- ticular before the people. Monday I spent the whole school  day at the Academy. There were 36 students, all that the vestry  of the Stake Tabernacle could accommodate. The desks were of  the best pattern, and the school supplied with maps, some ap- paratus, and utensils in a degree were credible to the good  judgement and energy of the Stake Board, Bro.

Midway where a meeting had  been arranged for me, to talk to the people on our educational  aims, as especially Bishop Van Wagener had given decidedly  the g cold shoulder to the Stake Board of Education. A crowded  meeting strongly in sympathy with me from the start on ac- count of the many German Saints among them made me feel  free in return and one of the results was that Bp. Van Wagner  endorsed in the warmest terms my remarks winding up with  the declaration, that the next time I should come around I  should find a church school in Midway. Tuesday visited the  school at Heber once more, and met in the afternoon with the  Stake Board, President Hatch and Counsellors present, having  joined the Board. The deliberations were conducted in a liberal  and unanimous spirit and concluded with the selection  of the old Stake Tabernacle, now called "Hatch's Hall" for the  Stake Academy Building. The whole Board adjourned to  said premises, to receive my suggestions about suitable arrange- ment of the premises; carpenters were called in, orders given  by Pres.

Cluff having been away at the time, and the  other members of the Board feeling reluctant to act without  him. This had a somewhat depressing influence in regard to  the number of students in attendance. Records, Daily Pro- gramme, and Plan of Studies were found quite satisfactory.  The school occupies the main hall of the Tabernacle for the  devotional exercises and the Preparatory Grade, a large Coun- cil Chamber for the Intermediate Grade, and another room  below was added, at my suggestion, for a Lady – Students  Room. On account of the absence from Coalville of several mem- bers of the Stake Board an informal meeting of that Board was  held in the evening, and the necessity of the engagement of another  lady – teacher with musical qualifications was made apparent.  Mrs. Jennie Markham was introduced to me by Pres.

Smith to  address the bretheren on the s object of my visit. My remarks were  warmly endorsed by President Smith and some of the Bishops.  Bro. Tolestrup gave me an outline of the condition of his Academy,  subjected his Records, Daily Programme, and Plan of Studies,  to my inspection, and introduced me to several leading fam- ilies around town. All of these points gave me evidence of  the high esteem in which Bro. Tolestrup is held by the Author- ities, People, and Students, and the efficiency of his labors.  Pres. Smith pronounced him to me, a benefactor to the  Stake. He is a professional Musician, vocal and instru- mental, and has given quite an impetus to the art suning  the people in Morgan. The singing in the Academy is  beautiful. Sunday was Y. M. M. I. A. Conference, to solid,  also several Bretheren the Presidency of the Seventies came.  In connection with them, the Presidents of the Associa- tions, and the Presidency of the Stake, we had three  very spirited meetings during the day and evening,  during which the subject of the education of the  rising generation as marked out by the General Board constituted the chicksubject of the addresses.

As this was the opening of a new term, a large influx of new  students took place, so much so that not sufficient accom- modations could be provided, and a short consultation  with Pres. Smith and the rest of the Board present was held,  in which it was decided to apply at once to the County  Court for the use of another room down stairs, additional.  That request was granted the same day and preparations  were in progress, when I was leaving, to have it ready  for occupancy in a few days. The subject of a lady – teacher  was urgently laid before the Board by me, and they  concluded to secure the services of Mrs. Mary Welch  for that purpose. I called on the lady with Principal  Tolestrup, and instructed her upon her duties, and she has  since taken the necessary steps to procure her License.  Randolph L. D. S. Seminary.

Coalville, to make an appointment for a  meeting at Evanston per Telegraph. Fearing, however, to dis- appoint the Randolph brethren, I did not dare to ac- cept the invitation. After a dreary stay of 24 hours at Evans- ton, knowing nobody there, I took stage for Randolph, Wed- nesday, Nov. 6. at 2 P. M. and arrived at my destination  at 8 P.

Being very stiff and cold from the  journey in an open wagon I could do no business that  evening anymore, but was ready for work the next  morning. The Seminary in charge of Principal Oluf Larson,  is in its second academic year, and holds its session in  the upper room of the Courthouse. The room is nice- ly fitted up with desks of the newest pattern, but poor- ly supplied with maps, necessary apparatus, and other  utensils. Bro.

A Board Mee- ting on Thursday afternoon, attended also by Bp. Lee, as  President, decided also to adopt my suggestion of the em- ployment of a lady – teacher, and united upon some one  whose acquaintance, however, I have not had the pleasure  of making this far. A crowded meeting in the evening  in the Meetinghouse concluded my labors at Ran- dolph. As this seminary is the only churchschool in  Rich County, and the feeling of the bretheren there  seems almost uniformly point to the hope that some  day they will be organized as a Stake for themselves,  and the status of their school, as well as the intelligent  management of the latter by the LocalBboard,  entitle  them to the kind of consideration of the General Board,  the proposition of elevating that Seminary to the grade  of an Academic suggested itself forcibly to my mind, and  I submit it, therefore, respectfully in this report.

The districtschool  at that place – being in charge of a young man from  Farmington, whose heart is in the work, who is a faith- ful Latterday Saint, and who unlike many of our  districtschool – teachers, desires, the further development  of the L.

There is a fine organ for  their devotional exercises, singing classes, choir practices, and  instrumental lessons; there are several sets of good maps,  geographical as well as physiological, and several  bouquets of flowers on the teachers desks provided the  affection as well as the good taste of the students. The  next day, being the first day of the Stake Conference, enab- led me to make the acquaintance of most of the lea- ding men throughout the Stake and to ascertain their  feelings in regard to our educational movement. I  am happy to state, that, so far as I could learn, the sympathy  with our churchschool movement is unanimous, assisted  materially by the condition of affairs prevailing now  throughout Idaho, in consequence of which the control  of the districtschools is entirely in the hands of the  Gentiles. It will become indispensable before long  to multiply, our churchschools in those regions as  fast as circumstances will permit in order to  provide the children of those L. D.

The greater portion of the  afternoon meeting was given into my hands for the purpose  of explaining to the audience the nature and object of our church- schools.  President Budge and Counsellors warmly endorsed  my remarks. Monday was also spent in attending Confer- ence meetings and private conversations with teachers  and members of the Board. It appeared from these  conversations that the influence of an educational ad- venturer, a Dr. Hessel, now dead, had been very pernicious  in Paris and neighborhood. He had raised the notions  of some of the Authorities, of the People, and of the Students  in their Academy to such a highly artificial pitch that  it was difficult for them, as Bro. Hart expressed it to  me, to come down to first principles again.  The Tuesday  morning I went to the Academy to witness the opening exer- cises and stayed with them during the whole day. After  school met with the teachers in consultation and talk- ed over with them the observations I had made during  the various recitations.

The theological classes, especially,  showed a spirit and progress which not only were very  credible to their present teachers of those students, but re- flected back upon the Sunday school work that must  have been done previously among those young people.  I should suggest to the General Board to recommend in  their next General Circular the adoption of the large  illustrated Sunday school Charts for Bible Stories, and  the Story of the Book of Mormon, the latter former for Primary  Grades, and the latter for advanced theological classes.  I have also noted with much satisfaction that the Ju- venile Instructor is used very extensively in our church- schools, and have, therefore, consulted already private- ly with Bro. Abraham Cannon, if that Periodical could  not be used occasionally as a means of for con- veying educational instructions of general applica- tion to our churchschool – teachers. – In the common  branches of the curriculum I found the students  poorly prepared considering the high pretensions  they had been made to entertain, but Bro.

In his parting words to me, he said: "You are the first  man since my great trouble that has shown me  official trust, and confidence and placed such great  responsibility upon me. With the help of God, I shall  strive that you shall not be disappointed." A Meeting  of the Stake Board in the evening closed the labors of the  day. I had known that at least two prominent members  of that Board had formally been rather advocates of  the University system and Dr. Hessel's maxious in oppo- sition to our ways of doing things, and that it was  owing solely to the persistent efforts of President Budge  that a better state of affairs in education there had  been effected. It was, therefore, with some anxiety  that I entered that meeting. After some incidental  business had been disposed of, Pres.

Train being 3 hours behind time, the bretheren  at Montpelier tried to persuade to take the Freight train and  travel the whole night rather than stay at the McCammon  hotel, for, if they should find out that I was a Mormon, I should  have the worst accommodation possible. As night traveling  means for me neither sleeping nor waking and incapaci- tates me the next day for mental efforts, I took my chances  for McCammon. They must have found out there,  that I was not of their kind at least, for it would be im- possible to offer anyone worst accommodations for his  money.

There is an advanced department, consisting of classes  of the Intermediate and Preparatory Grades, in charge of the  Carrie  Parkinson, as Assistant. The building is very inadequate  for school purposes. The Academy occupies the two rooms  on the ground floor, dark, dismal, and, I fear unhealthy.  The floor rotten in some places, and outhouses for the pupils are wanting entirely, which is an objection of a very grave  nature. There are no maps, no apparatus of any kind, and  the provisions made for the comfort of the pupils are of  the poorest kind.  As the building must be vacated at  the end of the school year, and the Academy is to be moved  to Preston, the Board does not feel to make any improve- ments besides whitewashing the walls to give the premises  a more cheerful aspect. I have urged upon the Board,  however, the necessity of making arrangements for a  permanent churchschool at Franklin, as there dis- tricts school is conducted by Gentiles, and our people do  not like to send their children there. This condition  of affairs is now prevailing throughout all the settlement  of the Saints in Idaho. I attended the classes of the Academy ENDENTRY WILFORD WOODRUFF, PRESIDENT. KARL G. MAESER, D. L.

These two teachers have a herculean  task before them to bring about a reformation in this respect. The exercises were conducted in a very credible  manner and the progress the children had made during  the ten weeks was very satisfactory. the young lady – teacher  did appear not to be very familiar as yet with the  mode of catechization but seemed to exercise a beau- tiful influence over her little pupils.

There is a tendency with some Stake Boards to run their  Academy only for two or three terms during the year, and  engage the teachers only for that time. Such a course  would be derogatory to the best interests of our Church- School Organization, as especially the Principles expect to  be employed for the whole year, or else the most efficient  of them will soon find other positions more suitable  for their interests, and such schools will always have  to be satisfied with make-shift-teachers, and thus be  kept at a low grade.

Dear Brethren:  With your consent Utah and  attend conference and receive new inspiration from the lips of the  servants of the Lord, and to attend to some very pressing business affairs that are crowding upon me. My visit will necessarily be a  short one, for I shall be anxious to return.  Shall I come?  I returned on the 13th. inst. from visiting the Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas conferences. This finishes my travels among the conferences for this season. There are now thirteen conferences in the  mission.  The mission is in a more prosperous and thriving condition than at any time in the past since I have been here.  The Elders are now traveling absolutely without purse or scrip as the Lord commands them to do, and are meeting with phenomenal success in reaching the people and holding meetings, baptizing souls, organizing branches and Sunday schools.  Within the last six weeks Elders Wakefield and Brown of the South Alabama conference held 34 meetings in one week; Elders Stahle of the North Carolina conference held fifty meetings in one week, the  meetings continuing from 50 minutes to 1 1–2 hours, and they had a number of applications for baptisms the same week; Elders Gordon of the South Carolina conference held 42 meetings in one week, baptized ten souls and had a number of applications for baptism besides. These are exceptional cases of course but it shows the spirit the Elders are of. ENDENTRY Southern States Mission, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Chattanooga, Tenn. P.O. Box 103.  It is getting to be a common thing for the Elders to hold 12, 15, 17 and 21 meetings a week.  Elders Thomas and Pace of the South Alabama conference held 84 meetings in one month, and attended to some baptisms. Other pairs of Elders are working to eclipse the record.  Dear Brethren, I only mention these details to show you the spirit that is taking possession of our Elders. They are working with a zeal that is indeed commendable, yet are not accomplishing nearly so much as I believe they are capable of doing with the help of the Lord. I am a firm believer in the truth, that there is no end to mans capacity for doing good, if he will but seek after God and keep His commandments.  The Elders are keeping the Word of Wisdom now, I believe, all throug^h^ the mission, and are teaching the Saints, friends and nearly all whom they stop with to do the same. Hundreds of people, not members of the church, are obeying this teaching. A strong effort is being made to convert the Saints to pay their tithes and offerings. Success is crowning our efforts. At this time the outlook indicates that the Elders will gather, this year, nearly $2000.00 in tithes and offerings.  One Charleston S. C., a very wealthy man, says he will pay $1500.00 this fall in tithing. One New Orleans will pay several hundred dollars. Others are paying and will pay $5.00, $10.00, $25.00, $50.00 andc.  When among the Saints, the Elders are requested to teach with power, seasoned with charity, the law of tithing, fast offerings, word of wisdom  and prayer. They are meeting with fair success. The Elders are acting in the capacity of teachers and priests as well as preachers.  Many conferences in the mission have baptized several times more souls already than they did in the whole year last year. The annual ENDENTRY Southern States Mission, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Chattanooga, Tenn. P.O. Box 103.  report this year will be reasonably satisfactory.  A very gratifying thing for you to know is that the Elders are "Capturing" villages, county seats and cities, and, while there, are stopping at hotels and with the leading citizens, many of whom come to them and beg of them to stay with them part of the time while they are sojourning in their midst holding series of meetings. Many of these parties are the great ones of this country—politicians, Judges, Lawyers, Doctors, Merchants andc. Occasionally these things have been met with in the past, but not so commonly as of late. The frequency of these occurrences have come to light since the Elders went out this summer from their conference gatherings to prove the Lord by traveling ABSOLUTELY without purse or scrip. I define these last six words to mean, that the Elders are to have no money to pay for washing nor even to buy stamps. They must go out, "for this commandment is unto all the faithful who are called of God in the church unto the ministery," ##Doctrine and Covenants 84:86## and trust implicitly to God to raise up friends to them, "who will give them food, who will give them raiment and who will give them money." ##Doctrine and Covenants 24:18## And I bear testimony that the Lord is fulfilling His promises to His Elders in every case where they are keeping "this commandment" and are in need of anything. The Lord is even, in cases where the Elders are scrupulously carrying out this "commandment," providing them with money to buy their tracts and books in publishing the gospel.  Dear Brethren, I understand these things are well known to you, for you have had years and years of experience in the Missionary field more than I, but I believe these things are gratifying to you to know,  for your hearts are in this great work of the salvation of the human family.  Dear Brethren, I feel with all my soul to sustain you as God's ENDENTRY Southern States Mission, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Chattanooga, Tenn. P.O. Box 103.

Praying God to bless you always, I remain,  Your brother in the gospel,  Elias S. Kimball.  P.S.  I inclose you letters from Elders Stohl with some comments to the Elders added. The object of sending these letters out to the Elders is to inspire them to greater exertion, for all of them are not russelers. Then again some few of them are not doing just as they should do.  Every pair of Elders in the mission will receive a copy of each one of these letters.  E. S. K. ENDENTRY headquarters Southern States Mission, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

Dear Brethren:  In answering your esteemed favor of May 10th., referring to fasting and indulging in a spirit of rivalry among the Elders in breaking records, I beg you will pardon me for the seeming delay that has occurred. I was away from the office when your letter came, and since returning my health has been very poor, but is fast im- proving.  I do not think I can say anything in answer to the question you  refer to that will so fully explain matters as to inclose several circular letters I have written to the Elders of this mission at differ- ent times. I would respectfully and especially call your attention to circular letters, dated March 25th, 1896, and April 12th, 1897, marked with blue pencil. You will please notice the brethren are left to do as they may deem proper, no restraint being placed on them. I have never desired  to make any iron rules by which to govern my brethren. That I have made many, very many mistakes, I am very frank to confess, and from what you say has come to your ears, I do not know but that I have made a grave mistake in saying so much about fasting as is contained in these letters. Instead of leading the mission in fasting, the different con- ferences have lead this office, as is intimated in circular letter of March 25th. As to fasting Sundays and Thursdays, I submitted this matter to the brethren laboring in the office, all of whom favored it and were  ENDENTRY headquarters Southern States Mission, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

Afterwards I was sorry that I did this, for I worried that it might prove a hard- ship on some of the new Elders. When we have had Elders laying very sick and they have written, requesting the Elders to fast and pray for them, I have written the conference Prest's. to notify their brethren to fast and pray for the sick among us. In no instance however, that I can  remember, have I ever suggested how long they should fast. It is true that some of the conferences, if not all of them, have held special fasts, have I ever suggested how long they should fast. It is true that some of the conferences, if not all of them, have held special fasts, but not at my dictation. Fasting in this mission seems to have  had its growth without any particular direction from any source, unless the Elders have been taught by the Holy Spirit, which I believe to be the case. Quite often word comes to the office of Elders who have just finished a fast preparatory to entering some city to canvass it. I have  never felt to reprove the brethren for thus fasting, but rather have felt  to rejoice that they have had faith in these things. I have tried to  look at these matters calmnly and dispassionately and do nothing that  would be contrary to the mind and will of the Lord, and would not in the least annoy you; and I do feel, my dear Brethren, that there is no cause for alarm that any of the Elders will be injured from too much fasting. It has been nearly two years since an Elder has died in this mission. While quite a number go home on account of sickness, as has always been the case, not nearly so many go home now, according to the number laboring here, as went home in 1894–5.

My testimony is, that never in the history of the mission has better health prevailed  among the Elders, nor have they ever at any time exhibited greater faith.  Referring to the spirit of rivalry among the Elders in holding the greatest number of meetings in a given time. Knowing your mind and will concerning this matter, I have repeatedly advised the brethren to guard against these things, and to be wise and prudent in all their acts. You  will note, in reading the enclosed circular letters, that I urge upon the brethren to hold large numbers of meetings, for it is my experience, when they do so, they make many friends and break down prejudice; but I have tried to word my letters in such a way that they would understand they were to do this for the sake of the cause and not for their own glory. I may have failed in my object, but I have used my best wisdom, God knows.  I have had no other purpose, in enclosing these circular letters, than to let you know what I am doing in the mission and the spirit I am of  in presiding over my brethren. I feel that you should have this in- formation.  I am grateful to you for your counsel and advice, and shall do my  very best in carrying out your wishes. I have no other desire in life than to serve God and keep His commandments and to sustain His Priest- hood on the earth.  The brethren join me in kindest regards and best wishes for your wellfare.

Woodruff, Smith.  Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brethren:  I hand you herewith a copy of a set of resolutions sub- mitted to me by the Elders of the West Va. Conference while attending said conference on the 1st,2nd. and 3rd. of August, requesting that I use every means in my power to have a paper published in the Southern States  Mission similiar to the Millennial Star.  Having already talked with you on this subject and having followed out your suggestions about learning cost of such a publication I herewith submit Messrs McGowan and Cooke's bid which furnishes said information:  "A paper the size and style of the Mellinnial Star wuld cost about $500.00 for twenty six editions of 600 copies."  There would be twenty six editions per annum.  Each Elder in the Mission would have to be patriotic and generous enough to subscribe for a copy and then work among Saints and friends to take the balance of the edition. There are now about 360 Elders in the mission.  I think every Elder in the mission will take hold of the project with the same spirit which actuates the Elders of the West Va. Conference.  If you are favorable to the project and will kindly recommend me to start it, I shall agree to make it self sustaining from the start,beg- inning its publication some time in the early winter.  A paper published in the interests of the mission would be a  great assistance to the Elders,and would help the work on wonderfully, in that it would encourage the Elders to greater exertion.  The paper,if started,could be called the Southern Star or any other name you might suggest.  Wishing to follow out your advice in the matter, I kindly submit this ENDENTRY Southern States Mission, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Chattanooga, Tenn. P. O. Box 100.

The reports at the end of this year willshow an astonishing growth all along the line.  There are a few of the Elders,at present,suffering some from the chills and fever and others ailments,but generally the health of the Elders is fairly good. The weather of late has been intensely hot and is very trying to them.  Praying the Lord to bless you I remain,  Your brother in the Gospel,  Elias S.

Dear Brother:  Thought perhaps a report from this mission would be of interest so make my first attempt.  Since the year 1875 six hundred and twenty two elders have labored in this mission and the results have been that  4000 souls have been baptised. Twenty four hundred have emigrated. leaving as near as we can assertain about 1400 people scattered throughout the mission. The elders reset the saints from time to time, but find many of them luke warm  and on account of their poverty are unable to gather out  The greater portion of our people are emigrating to New Mexico. The remainder are joining their friends in different parts of Utah. Very  few are going to Colorado.  We think if of vital imporance that locations in  Arizona, Mexico, and New Mexico are should be designated so that  we can counsel the saints to emigrate to said places. At present the people are in doubt. and we are unable  to counsel them.  In the past two months we have made great ENDENTRY progress. Elders have left old worn out fields, and in many instances have congregations from 100 to 400, that are very anxious by enquiring for the Truth. This recasions great joy. A new opening was made in ocean about three months ago, and to-day we have twelve elders in that neighborhood. Persecution is not common and prejudice is very much allayed. We notice a very great difference  at our head-quarters, Chattanooga.  The general health of the elders is good, although we have reason to release about one third of them on  account of failing health. Total number of elders now laboring is seventy two. We to-day released thirteen of  our most prominent fright workers. This weakens our strength.  Could they have remained they are prepared to commence laboring in Cities ^and^ villages amongst the rich and learned,  but we do not feel justified in retaining them longer than two years, as this estimate, connected with so muc ex- posure is a great strain on their constitutions. If you think best we can use them three years.  We are very anxious to commence to labor in  cities, villages, and towns, and reach the rich and educated, but as you well know, until our young men have had from  one to two years of experience, do not feel competent, and for this reason rather prefer to be in the wards amongst the  poor and preach to them. They ^the poor^ have been warned almost entirely and for the above reason.  ENDENTRY We feel that now is the time to begin to place our mission of a higher platform, not that we infer that it  has not been tried before, but circumstances have changed and to-day there is no better opportunity in the world.  If elders catch a reasonable education, humble, fearless and ^that^ will make a good appearance are sent out, they can in our oppinion do a great work. This mission has been called the faby mission, but is proud that it has educated 692 elders that are distributed amongst our people, and are prepared to educate hundreds more, but in doing so our  progress is necessarily slow. If one half of our missionaries  understood the gospel, the other half we could handle niec- ly and continue converting people.  The impression has gone abroad among the greater part of our people that the Southern States is a good place to suffer persecution, wear out old clothes, and that it is not necessary to make a good appearance, and a fear has  crept into the hearts of and parents. This foolish idea should be cried down, as it is a mistake. We say, that plenty of faith, good Prince Albert suits ^and^ white shirts, will do wonders in this mission, if they are worn by humble  the servants of the Lord.  Our elders are heroes, and we are proud of them, but  in making mention of the above facts, we do not do so with a  fault finding spirit, but for the purpose of calling grave attention to these false notions, as we deem them. ENDENTRY Have not as yet taken steps to rent a hall of 'Church'  and advertise services in Chattanooga, but have written Bro. Morgan regarding the above, as was suggested. Chattanooga is a central point where our emigrations gather to emigrate. In our quiet way we are gaining friends, but should we commence preaching the gospel we will stir up a hornets nest it might be wisdom  to leave this place until a later time, however, breth- eren, you just say the word and we will do all we  can. We are very much hampered for means.  If one hundred elders could be kept in the South all the time they could be used to good advantage.  We trust, dear brethren, you will feel deeply inter- ested in the Southern States Mission. If anything has been said that is out of place, please correct us, and with great pleasure we will accept any counsel and suggestions you may offer and will bend our energies to carry them out. Ever praying for blessings to rest upon you the breth- eren. Elder Moses H. Taylor joins me in kind regards to all.  Your Brother TC J. G.

No cases of mobocracy has been reported for some little time.  The last one being that affair in South Carolina. The main points of which I gave you before leaving Salt Lake.  After the particulars were presented to the proper author- ities they positively refused to issue warrans for the arrest of the mobocrats or to have anything to do  in the matter. The lawless element of justice,  dropped out of the case entirely after receiving his fil, concluding I presume, there was not so much popularity attending the defense of mormons as he had at first imagined. The brethren who are labor- ing there feel perfectly at ease however, a reaction of public opinion having set in and a more kindly  feeling is extended toward them than has been of late. ENDENTRY There has been but little threatening indulged in of late, although I hold this as no very favorable omen for whenever success is found attending the labor of  the Elders it is usually found that the hatred of the evil one is aroused afresh and willing agents are always found to cause trouble in the localities where the good may have been done. However this is a  busy time of year with the masses here, and they have something else besides the mormons to turn their attention to at present.  Some few baptisms are being reported and the brethren all seem to be actively engaged in pushing along their work. So far I am informed their health is generally good, there being but one or two who is  suffering from chills and they are not serious by any means.  We are preparing for a small company of Saints to leave here on 20th ient for the West.

President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City  Utah  Dear Brother  On my arrival this morning  from a visit to some of the Conferences of the  mission I found your three letters awaiting me. Concerning the first. I would state that I shall be leaving tomorrow to visit the North Carolina Conference and will then  hand Elder Jolley his release as you have  instructed me, and he shall leave as soon as he can conveniently do so.  Elder James B. Ririe has been honorably  released for some time past, and has  been awaiting such improvement in his condition, as to permit of him taking the journey home. I left him yesterday feeling  much better, in fact so much so that I would  have brought him down with me, had it ENDENTRY not been for the heavy rains making it im- possible for I instructed  him, however, to make a start as soon as the weather would permit. We have always tried to impress upon the Elders the neces- sity of keeping us informed of their true condition, physically, and have taken precautions against sickness making inroads upon our numbers. Many of the brethren  however, in their intense desire to remain at their posts, refrain from acquianting  us with the facts, until their condition has descended a serious phase, and we are compelled to await a recovery or rather a  partial one, before they can be moved.  However I shall follow your instructions  closely in regard to this matter, and sincerely trust that a repetition of our  recent trouble may be avoided in the  future.  Enclosed you will please find the  semi annual report of this Mission which  I trust will be acceptable to you. It is not as good showing as the one of a corres- ponding time last year, but I attribute this  ENDENTRY to the fact, that owing to our desire to avoid unncessary excitement, we have not been  as agressive as we have been in the past.  While on my recent trip I visited the West Virginia Conference, and met with  those Elders—whom you wrote me of as having received false revelations—and also others connected with the conference. I found the  situtation to be a very deplorable one—much  damage having been done. The brethren  immediately connected with the affair had entirely destroyed the confidence of the  Saints and their friends, and for the part they had taken in the matter I found it  necessary to administer a severe rebuke, and  ended by removing the President of the  Conference-Elder Wilson-and appointing another in his stead. I am pleased to state that none of the Saints but the woman immediately  concerned, believed anything that was given ENDENTRY them by the opposing power, but on the contrary  advised the brethren to remain away and  have no communication with it, but in their  blindness the Elders were completely carried away and lost to all reason. However now they have seen their sin. They have sorely repented, and I think will not  soon forget the lesson they have been taught.  It will take some time to build that confer- ence up to what it was before this affair took  place, but I am hopeful of success eventually  The brethren concerned has been sent to a  distant post of the conference, owing to the  fact that very bitter feelings were manifested toward them by parties acquianted with the facts.  Owing to vacancies already made and the number of Elders to be released this fall I shall require 30 more Elders to supply  our wants, and should be greatly pleased if they could all arrive before 15th of November  as I should like to see and talk with them  before my departure with our next company  for the West.  With kindest regards Your Brother  William Spry  ENDENTRY OFFICE OF  SOUTHERN STATES MISSION CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.  P.O. Box 103,  Chattanooga, Tenn., 13th March 1890  President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City Utah  Dear Brother- My telegrams have before this apprised you of the death of Elder Holliday. also my letter of 9th last speaking of his illness has doubtless been received. When I left him last Friday morn there was such a marked improvement in  his condition that I considered there was no necessity for me to remain longer, so I came away leaving Elder Hack President of that Conference and a companion to look after our  brothers welfare. I am informed  that he continued to mend until about 18 hours before his death when he took a relapse  and sank rapidly until he passed away. Pnemmonia was  the cause of death. it being brought on by an attack of "La Grippe" No attention was paid to his first attack and after recovering he moved to another part of the field  and was there taken down again about the 23rd last and remained there until he died. I knew nothing of his illness until I was notified by wire to go to him immediately His companion tried to reach others of the brethren by mail when he was first taken but owing to high water the mail had stopped running. then they sent for me.  ENDENTRY While with him we anointed him a number of times and  after I left the brethren continued to exercise their faith in his behalf which with the assistance rendered by two of the leading physicians of the country kept him alive doubtless several days. I would say however the physicians  told his companion they could do no more for him even a week before he died, and when we saw the improvement made under our administration we could not keep but feel hopeful and I must confess that when I left him I had no other idea than that he would recover. But the Lord has willed it otherwise, and we bow in submission to His will. I have written Sister Holliday this morning.  Enclosed you will please find statement of expenditure part of which has been paid by borrowing money and the rest is yet due. Should you see proper to remit the amount to us I should feel very grateful and it would place us in a position to meet the demand.

In- stead they are scarcely one half. I had been misinformed.  I am engaged at present time in visiting the different Conferences in the Mission. I have already visited three  of them and find their affairs in a fairly prosperous con- dition New fields have been found so far where all the Elders could return to and where there were a sufficient  number of investigators to keep them busily engaged.  Several have already been baptised this month and more have applied which applications will be attended to as the Brethren return to their fields of labor. In fact most of our baptisms were performed during the past two months.  There is quite a friendly feeling existing toward us ENDENTRY in many places and our conference meetings have been largely attended. We meet with the spirit of  mobocracy occasionally, but as a rule there has been less opposition during this present season than there has been for some few years past particularly last year I find the Elders feeling well in their labors and en- couraged at the prospects ahead of them, for in many places we seem to have good opportunities for doing good There are again some places and communities where Elders can do but little if any good at all, being wither met with indifference or strong theatening, and while I do not propose to risk the life of any man here yet I find that by working cautiously in the face of opposition we can usually succeed in finding  a few who are sufficiently honest to receive the Gospel It is the indifference of the people we can do nothing with.  The health of Elders is generally good as far as I can learn. I know of none just now but who are in fair health. The spirit of gathering is cultivated continually among the Saints and after visiting the Conferences I expect to start west with a good sized company This will be toward the close of November.

In  addition to the two others notified—Elders Taylor and Worthington— we shall be pleased to receive three more to supply  and meet the demand made on us. We are ready for them as soon as they can make it convenient to come.  Just at present we are meeting with but little opposition here; the Elders all seem to be employed and all the reports coming in from the different Conferences are quite favorable and we are led to believe that much good will result from  the labors of the Elders in the near future.

On my arrival at office I found the affairs of the mission in a prosperous con- dition as I hope our report, which will be sent you early next month, will show The Elders generally are enjoying good health and meeting with fair treatment at the hands of the people among whom they travel. They are also finding some who are willing to take upon themselves the name of Christ and our number of  baptisms during the past season will ENDENTRY exceed those of a corresponding time  last year according to my present calculation Altogether I feel very much encouraged and gratified at our past success and the prospects before us, and my desire is to continue in the discharge of my  duty and, with the help of the Lord and the assistance of my brethren associated  with me spread the Gospel among those who sit in darkness and establish  Truth in this land.  I have appointments out for the next  three months to meet the Elders in their respective conferences, meetings being held every Saturday and Sunday. I  can then the more thoroughly acquiant  myself with the general situation of  affairs, and so place the brethren as I  ENDENTRY may be directed and as will do the greatest  amount of good. I am satisfied our  meetings together will result in a better understanding being obtained as to what is  required of us and thus be beneficial to  the Cause.  Previous to my departure from home  I asked Bro Reynolds to furnish us with 15 more Elders by November. Since my  arrival here I find we are in need of 2 additional men and if 2 could be found who could leave at once for the Mission I should be pleased as we can use them to advantage immediately on their arrival. However in this we shall of course await your own and their conven- ience.  At any time you may have any  ENDENTRY comment or instruction pertaining to my- self or the Mission I shall be more than pleased to receive it for I desire to labor in strict unison with the wishes of my brethren who preside over me.

P.O. BOX 103.  Chattanooga, Tenn., 8th October 1890  President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake Utah  Dear Brother -  On my return from middle Tennessee  Conference I find your letter awaiting me, and will state that the instructions given shall be followed closely  Elder Moses Taylor has already been notified that he is at liberty to return home at any time to attend to his land matters and we are now awaiting his re- ply as to the date of his departure.  So far as we could we have endeavored to pursue a  policy such as you suggest regarding the emigration of  the Saints from this Mission at the same time we might  not have exercised that caution perhaps in some cases as  we should have done, in fact I am satisfied that some  individuals have gathered to Zion unworthily. We have the names of individuals upon our records who have  been baptised at different times from the days of Elder Jedediah Grant and others to the present. I have found  that in all cases where people have been baptised so  very many years ago they have become so completely ENDENTRY fossilized that there is no power on earth apparently  that would cause them to leave their homes and cast their lot with the body of the Church. We have another  class who have been baptised unto some particular  Elder unfortunately, and notwithstanding their pro- fessed love for the Gospel they as a rule are not able  to withstand the trials they must and so amount to but little as far as giving strength to the Cause is concerned.  Some of them may conclude to emigrate at times and select the settlement or ward when their particular Elder resides, and finding him either too busy with his own affairs to pay much attention to them or perhaps having grown cold or indifferent himself, they, failing to receive that warmth necessary to keep their spark of life beaming, fall also.  It has been our counsel to the Elders all along to avoid  having any of the Saints emigrate in ignorance of what they will be called upon to pass through upon reaching Zion,  and to sing the song "Think not where you gather to Zion" andc often and if it is so they cannot sing to read it to them, that all may have their eyes opened to things as they actually  exist. We also counsel the Brethren to avoid in every way having the Saints locate near to them, for we have ceen the bad effects of it in so many instances, but to urge them to emigrate to places which have been selected for them and where they can be surrounded by a  people of their own kind and temperment.  ENDENTRY We also prefer them to see that Saints do not gather too early after their baptism but rather to have them remain until they have become sufficiently strong to meet trials teaching and instructing them in the meantime upon  their duties and obligations as Saints of God. By doing  this, as you suggest, a greater number of homes are maintained for the Elders, and through their good works which are manifested their neighbors and associates are led to awknowledge the superiority of the Gospel over that of the man made systems of the day. Our Saints here as a rule are poor, some very poor indeed, hence they are not in a position to render any financial support either to the Elders or the Mission in fact it is quite frequent that the Elders contribute to them in order that they may obtain the absolute necessities of life An account was received today  of a case where salt could not be obtained to put with meal for bread purposes owing to a lack of money which small amt.  the Brethren supplied themselves. Owing to the system followed here and the poverty of the soil it is frequently the case that men fail to handle a dollar of the returns of their crops. Their earnings for the entire season being consumed in plain food and a scanty  ENDENTRY supply of clothing to themselves and family furnished them by landowner and it is no uncommon thing for them to be found in debt even for this at the end of year or when a "settlement" is made. You can readily see from this that we can expect nothing from them whatever in the way of  support. Such people when they do emigrate do so on the  generosity of friends or relatives in the West. However I am very grateful for the counsel you have given me on this matter and hereafter we shall endeavor to have  none but faithful Saints gather to Zion.  At any time you may have counsel or advice for me I shall be much pleased to receive it for I desire to  so conduct my labors that they may be in accord with the mind of my brethren who preside over me.

I trust it will prove acceptable to you. As you will notice  our number of baptisms have decreased more than one half than those of a corresponding time last year. The Elders labor- ing here however have labored as valiantly and earnestly as ever before, losing no opportunity afforded them of reaching the people, and the only cause I can attribute for the falling away, is that the honest in heart are becoming more scarce and that the numbers are not to be found today in Babylon who will receive the Gospel as there were in former years.  The brethren generally are hardworking, energetic men in the ministry, full of hope and willing to do all they can, or go wherever they may be sent to further the Cause of Truth. They are faithful and true to this calling, and by their example cannot fail to excite the admiration of their fellow men, even though that admiration may be kept a secret in the breasts of those in whom it may  be aroused. ENDENTRY Chief Justice Alexander White, in  charging the Grand Jury, Salt Lake  City, February, 1876, said:  I HAVE not nor do I propose to enter upon a discussion of the mor- ality or immorality of polygamy,  practiced by a people, who in other respects, are law abiding, moral and  upright. Upon that point you would probably differ among your- selves, and a portion of you differ from the court. With the ethics of  the subject neither you as grand jurors nor as I as a court have any- thing to do.  I do not utter the language of  prejudice, nor treat lightly or de- risively the Mormon people or their faith. No matter how much I differ from them in belief, nor how widely they differ from the American peo- ple in matters of religion, yet test- ing them and it by a standard which the world recognizes as just, that is,  what they have practices and what  they have accomplished, and they  deserve higher consideration than ever has been accorded to them.  Industry, frugality, temperance,  honesty, and in every respect but one, obedience to the law, are with them the common practices of life.  This land they have redeemed from sterility, and occupied its once barren solitudes, with cities, vill- ages, cultivated fields and farm houses, and made it the habitation of a numerous people, where a beg- gar is never seen and alms-houses are neither needed or known. These  are facts and accomplishments  which any candid observer recog- nizes and every fair mind admits.  SWEARING, drinking, gambling,  idleness and licentiousness have  made but small headway among the Mormons, who are a very sincere  people. There is less licentiousness  in Salt Lake City than in any other  of the same size in the United States.  - Elder Miles Grant, Ed. World's Crises  I HAVE to admit I never gazed  upon a scene so charming as Salt Lake City and Valley present.  Thee are among the Mormons sci- entific architects, skilful artisans  and tasteful landscape gardeners.  Everywhere there are indications  of thrift and neatness and com- fort. The people of the United  States are under obligations to the  Mormons, for they have brought to  the country many thousands of in- dustrious, peaceable and skilful peo- ple and added largely to its wealth.  - Henry Hugh McCollough, Sec. U.  S. Treasury.  I HAZARD nothing in saying that there is no State or Territory in the  Union where there is as much con- jugal felicity, or the families of the  State live more happily together than  the Mormons do in Utah. - Senator Ga.  "THE Mormons have no drones.  Everyone works with a will. They  are energetic, industrious, economi- cal, and self-relying. They have a  splendid, robust looking lot of chil- dren." - Governor Arizona.  The Mormons have achieved vic- tories and conquests over the most gigantic evils that curse our race,  and which to-day are chief banes of every civilized State. - Dr. Miller,  Ed. Omaha Herald.  SALT LAKE CITY is one of the most quiet, orderly and moral places in  the world. The Mormons are chaste,  laborious, cheerful and the most  temperate of Americans."- Hon.  Bayard Taylor.  THE Mormons are a brave, patient, hard-working people and devoted to their Church. - Gen. James S. Bris- bin.  THE CONSTITUTION of the United  States was given by the inspiration  of God. - Joseph Smith ENDENTRY We have had a great amount of sickness to continued work in the past and numbers of the brethren have been com- pelled to return home on that account. Even now we have one quite serious case, but one which I feel satisfied  will recover and be enabled to return home shortly. I  was called away to him suddenly last week and returned to office last night. I found him very low indeed in fact so much so that the doctors who had been attending him  had given him up and could do nothing more for him but  expected to find him dead at each visit. However through the blessing of the Lord he was out of danger when I left him ^and^  with care and good exercising he will soon recover. The name  is Pleasant Grove Utah Co. and his complain . The other case Elder Sith H. Thomas about whom  you wired me, is not so bad as reported to you. I presume the anxiety of a fond mother caused the information to be  sent you. Bro Thomas is unwell, but upon investigation I find not seriously so, although as the church here does not seem to agree with him he has his release to return home, and will doubtless leave in the near future.  I have also returned from a trip into Alabama where ENDENTRY sideways text W. Spry 9 March. 1890.

That portion of the people, which has no mind and thought of their own (the ragged proletariat) sells its franchise to the highest bidder, not  caring, how the thinking portion of the people  feels about it, and how they suffer in  consequence of it, neither how they are dissatis- fied with such doings, - simply becaus they (the unthinking portion) are in the majority.  Harrisons cost of his obtaining the presidency  is 5000000 Dollars. The American people has to be looked upon as an aggressive people,  they care nothing about the conducting of  national affairs, their only aim is now the  running of the natural resources for all ENDENTRY they are worth, the forests, wines, coal deposits,  are run out and down; the social relations are likewise run down, the human being is also nothing but a mere machine, until they will stand there, degraded like slaves,  not caring nor thinking, that this state of  affairs must finally bring about the running  down ^and scattering^ of the present people.  Now In their spirit of haughtiness they the American people have now for the third time  tackled the Mormon people, in order that, in spite of the provisions fo the  Constitution, (which latter of course may not  be fitted for the present times) - it may be  made as difficult as possible for them (the Mormons) to exist. Through this action the Nation has created for itself an enemy,  the second one in the Union, and one of no  mean proportions and importance at that;  because it is a well Known fact, that Brigham Young has heaped up Millions and has educated his young men to be good fighters, all for the purpose to ward off ENDENTRY and to rid himself of this low aggressive  and abusive people (the people of the U.S.)  and to create a state within the state.  Now, you good but illtreated Mormons, look  out for companions in your dilemma. I do  not mean for the Chinese, who partly out of revenge on account of their expulsion from our borders,  and partly on account of the overpopulation at  home have to seek better countries. The Chinese ^even^ arms himself considerably, he has had the best ironclads constructed for his service, and has ordered 800 of the best and largest cannon of "Krupp", if they are not allready made.  This would make a good fight, for which our good Yankee is not a match, because his  beautiful country is ruined from countre to  circumference, and the allmighty Dollar will hardly save him. That job needs smart heads and shure hands.  As I have just now been informed, the Mormons are on the lookout in Brittish  America, to hide themselves from it in the far up northern country from the oppression ENDENTRY
