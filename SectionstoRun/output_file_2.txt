In reply I take pleasure in stating that anything I can do to aid in aid of musical progress in our community I shall take great pleasure in doing. and shall willingly cooperate with the Brethren mentioned in the matter.  As I have hitherto been almost alone in this branch of general musical Education. I have keenly felt the wont of what we are now about to seek for—especially "more uniform method" As much of the fruit of my labors would  be annulled through the inability of my students to follow up this musical studies in the same order as they began, when circumstances would place them under other teachers.  Indeed, (if I may be pardoned for going so far.) I have long felt that it is not only in our institutions of learning that this want of musical uniformity has been painfully apparent. our choirs—(and that constitutes all our practically  religious musical organizations)—neither work in uniformity  ENDENTRY successful to leave a little yet in the treasury of our large choir. after denoting $820.00 towards our new seats and platform and between eight and nine hundred dollars in new music, and about $275.00 spent in training classes last winter.  this the past entertainments have made it possible to supply the large chairs without calling for aid. Our juvenile choir is not so fortunate. The cold weather of last Christmas when they gave their concert made their receipts but little over expenses. and such of their parents as  felt disposed have paid 50.cts each to help pay incidental expenses, such as the assistants I have had to have. and new music for the little Band, etc.  Now that I have laid their present and past financial status briefly before you what I desire to know is relative to the future. What may I resort to with ENDENTRY with one—another. nor with any institutions (singing classes or scholols of music that should be preparing their members for usefulness in these choir. today the music teacher and the choir leader seldom understand each others aims sufficiently to make use of each others efforts. my views are, that our whole choir system should be united in one grand organization, headed by the tabernacle Choir of this city (that organization attaining such a point of  excellence that all other choirs would be proud to own it as fit for this position, and gladly cooperate with it in every stride for advancement.) then the grand aim of our institutions of learning should be to train the young up to readily take their proper places in this ^grand^ organization thus making the musical branch an aid to practical results ^work^ in our church musical organizations. just as the Theological  branch is an aid to practical labor under the priesthood  in the our general church organizations.  this would mean a thorough musical training, with an  aim constantly pointing to the highest use of it in the worship of God. It appears to me that our method of studying music in the church schools can never be what it should ENDENTRY permission to use the tabernacle (as it would be out of the question to venture to try to raise any means from a concert with our host of participants, in any smaller place.) in order to to keep in nessesary funds these bodies com- prising over fifteen hundred singers, young and old.  First Can our night during the coming Conference be used, say for their guist benifit. Both choirs taking part in turn? If not, would the night of the 21st of October (Landing of Columbus) be suitable for a like purpose?  Second is it decidedly objectionable and out of the question to permit Gilmore and his great Band to appear in that building in conjunction with our choirs? I ask this not to urge it upon you as I am entirely satisfied to leave such matters to you who know best. Still, personaly – ef there is no weighty objection over which we can have no central ENDENTRY be, untill we can systematically aim at this.  I believe our needs as a community calls for a distinct method, or course, to meet our own peculiar wants. and that it is perfectly useless for us to try and copy after the methods used in the "East" or the "West" only in general principle  such as dictation etc; which of course should be that universally used. But we should have our own Text Books, carefully made to meet our own wants. the study of music constantly mingles  with sentiments as expressed in the words sung. the one enlarging the other. hence how necessary that these sentiments should be in  keeping with our ultimate aim religiously.  I realize that I have stepped out of my domain in a strict sence, in the mention of choir work: and that there we, as a committee, will be powerless at present. But, from any peculiar way of looking at it, the two are so closely allied that it seemed my duty to mention it here.  I will immediately put myself in communication with the brethren mentioned. and trust we shall be able to accomplish much good.  yours Respectfully. Evan Stephens  850. E. lot South St  Salt Lake City ENDENTRY It would naturally be a very desireable thing for me to have them appear with us. their great artistic excellence gives us new life and impetus to progress. While sharing the financial proceeds would be more certain and effective than of aid to us than appearing ourselves before a public who can always hear us for nothing. the adult choir could take the benifit of evening performances and the  children the afternoon. It would certainly give us an opportunity to draw aid from all classes of the Salt Lake community because of their desire to enjoy the Band. not calling on them for charity sake to aid us, which they are not over ready to do. Then Mr Gilmore is such a fine old gentleman so honorable, so full of practical encouragement and interest in and for have musical organizations we have today three hundred books which he left on his last visit containing some of our finest selections, for which he charged us  not a cent. All there reasons make me ENDENTRY plead for him, as I would for no other musical organizations. then the fact that his great organization (this year more than doubled in strength) has always heretofore been granted the building because of its great merit that the people might hear him would, it seems to me, silence all reasonable unfavorable comment from our enemies for using the building.  Now having laid my feelings before you fully, I will only add that if you still deem it impracticable or impossible to permit the use of the building iether for us to aid him or they to aid us, I will be content with your decision. But if otherwise I should be glad as a cooperator and one who owe him  much gratitude for his kindness and consideration in the past to be the one permitted to convey him the good news, when you reply to me. He intends to make a Western tour in October I believe but will not come here if the tabernacle cannot be obtained. ENDENTRY to the Presidency, of the church, and Salt Lake Stake,  Brethren,  In taking upon myself the dutyies you have required of me as conductor of the tabernacle choir I deem it nessesary to—in some way—place before you what seems to me nessesary to do in order to acceptably fullfill the same. Stating my own plans and asking for such assistance as I may need to carry them out if they meet your approval.  First. I wish to enlarge the choir to about 300 members this assinsuring an attendance of at least 200 every sabbath. the organ, the building, the talent arround us, seems to call for nothing less than this at the very least. the aid I need is this, some changes and extensions of the present seating capacity of the choir. Copies of the music to be sung. (there is at present not more than 100 copies of any piece of music belonging to the choir, and not half a dozen pieces with over 45 copies. thus we need at least 150 copies of the Hymn tune Book, and at least Six ^new^ anthems. 300 copies each which would in all be about $300, three hundred Dollars for music. I am now getting some, to work upon, at my own expense as I must at once interest my ENDENTRY Is it objectionable as a rule to engage any foreign talent to take  part in our tabernacle concerts. I ask this because there are times when it is very difficult for us who are constantly heard at have, free of charge, to interest the public to come to our support while the appearance of some noted artist would awaken the public to attend. If we raise funds to go to the Wardel's train every means of drawing aid will be much needed, provided that there be no higher considerations standing in the way.  I fear I have converd my questions in as way wards. So will bare them be ^a^ summary.  Can we use the tabernacle one night ^during Conference^ for a concert? – If not, ^may we^ on the Date of Landing of Columbus? is it out of the question to have Gilmore and his band appear with us – or we with them for a Festival two nights and one afternoon?  Is it objectionable to have noted artists passing here engaged to aid us in our concerts? ENDENTRY singers with good music, and cannot wait for help.  Second. I should like to make a feature of using our own anthems, (when deserving and appropriate.) instead of that imported from the east and specially composed to suit sectarian notions and popular taste. there are a few composers among our community who can write inspired music and I should like to encourage such to more and higher attempts by using the best they can create for our use.  To do this we should publish them ourselves and do everything possible to have all  choirs throughout the entire community subscribe for them and use them. Thus making the cost of publication light, and at once reach a unity of action as choirs that would enable us to progress together. and at any time join together in these songs of praise only not amalgamate the choirs of a stake at a stake conference? And all attending at a general conference? At present it cannot be done, as scarcely any two choirs know the same songs, each leader selecting whatever he may have stumbled accross at ^some^ music store while at conference—etc. But I believe our ENDENTRY these questions never to my knowledge thoroughly settled, you will percieve are of considerable interest to me in my to one not small battle with music and finance, as they will give me better to understand what tools I may use, and what field I have  open in which to labor  Trusting you can spare time for a consideration soon, and will favor me with a reply  I am your Bro  Evan Stephens Conductor of the tabernacle choir and the juvenile choir  Address E. Stephens #43. Alameda Ave. Salt Lake City ENDENTRY choir Leaders would gladly rally to work unitedly if they could get suitable pieces published and selected with care for them. Especially if they were enabled to procure this music. the authorities of the various wards could, I think, get the people to aid them by donating a little means to get new music for their choirs.  Such an arrangement would also very much lessen our tabernacle choir's expence for new music, as two thousand copies cost but little more than one thousand to publish.  third. I should like to better reward singers for their faithfullness in attending to this duty and labor of love. It is no small task for c choir members to attend practices and properly prepare themselves for the performance of this duty constantly week after week, and year after year. I doubt if there is another duty to which both church members are called—excepting foreign missions—requiring such a sacrifice of means, time, and labor, as that of choir member if properly ENDENTRY attended to. often the very training of our best  singers would amount to hundreds of dollars each  if paid for. And they are not always fortunate enough  to get this for nothing.  In my judgement, there should be a training school in connection with our choir, where all members  could have at least ordinary instructions free of  charge. Those possessing extraordinary voices and  talents even that individual care and training that result in ^the^ greatest perfection possible.  (I mean private instructions)  A fund should be created for this in some way. As I do not understand that my duties as  conductor includes that of music teacher. (only  so far as preparing them for their sabbath duties  go, as my predesessars have done, and as much  better as possible.) Perhaps the means to carry on  such a scheme could be raised by our own efforts  as a choir, if permitted to give sacred concerts in the building: setting no deffinite charge for admission but letting permitting every one attending to give what  ever he chose towards such a fund. Such work rather  semes to increase the interest of singers rather than  weary them if successfully done. ENDENTRY SALT LAKE  CHORAL SOCIETY.  THE LEADING MUSICAL ORGANIZATION OF THE WEST  PROF.

While the music published by our own  enterprising publishers, (The News and Juvenile Inst Co.) is but little bought and used. All for the want  of funds.  I have thought that an entertainment  devoted to that purpose and given on the  most favorable night that could be spared  during the April Conference, in the Tabernacle  could aid us much, if there are not insuroundable  objections to using the Building for the purpose.  To make a beginning I would propose  aiding the Twenty five or Thirty Choirs in and  near Salt Lake City. Letting all the choirs unite  in one body with the Tabernacle Choir.

Such is my aim. have I your permission  to go to work to accomplish it all as suggested  and shall I have your hearty support to make  it a success?  Some few changes are sadly neeed about  the organ in order to have it more effective  and servicable in aiding the choir.

But ENDENTRY the ward for patronage, or subscribers, and  then dividing up the proceeds as follows. One half the gross receipts to defraying expenses  and to the Tabernacle Choir.  The other half to  be divided to the ward choirs according to  the number of singers taking part and the  number of tickets disposed of in each ward.  "In unity there is strength."  And with our  twentieth part the trouble of each trying to  raise funds for itseflf, we could join together  with much profit to all the choirs, and the artistic benefits of such a "Union Choir" would  be great.  Something is needed to lift our ward choirs  to a higher level of proficiency. Many feel  more or less discouraged because they have not  music enough to keep them interested.  At another time the invitation might be extended  to Ogden, and other choirs. And  ENDENTRY it cannot all be done at once. And  I should like the choir established on a  successful basis first. it will then be  able to aid me in all other praiseworthy  efforts towards advancement.

ENDENTRY Evan Stevens  Salt Lake City  April 2nd 1890  Prest Woodruff  Dear Bro.  Through your kindness a few  months since we were favored with a music- al treat in the Tabernacle that awakened  a new musical interest in our community. I have reference to the Gilmore Concerts, at  which the fine local chorus, surprised the  eastern artists as well as themselves, and  their friends at home.  The result has been that our singers have  formed themselves into a permanent organ- ization and are now prepared to do work  on their own account.  In their behalf, I now write you to ask a  continuation of the favor that gave them exist- ence, namely the use (on reasonable terms) of the  only building in our terriotory where an organi- zation of their size could hold forth, for a  grand musical festival, of three great  ENDENTRY concerts, about the middle of May next. Two, or Three, places only in america have  these musical treats, annually. And with  our glorious organ, Tabernacle, and host of  remarkable voices that we can boast of,  we can in one of the most refining arts, soon hold our own with the best of them.  A chorus of about 500 singers, and every good  instrumentalist in the city, and our many  excellent solo singers will all be brought to  work at their very best. And possibly Miss  Emma Juck, the very best american sing- er before the public, (both from moral and artistic view) will be engaged to aid us in  making it such an interesting affair as to  warrant an attendence from all the coun- try for a thousand miles around.

At a meeting, held  recently, of the program committee, of which they had elected  me chairman, it was urged upon me to solicit you for the use  of the Tabernacle in which to hold this musical festival;  associating with it the tabernacle choir, into whose treasury  they are willing to turn over twenty per cent of gross receipts  from the three meetings contemplated.  As it will create cons^i^d- -erable interest throughout musical circles everywhere, and amg among the Welsh people in particular.  While most of the benef- -it must accrue to our own organizationss choirs etc. (Prizes  to the amount of nearly two thousand dollars will be given.) which will having a tendency to stimulate our musical organizat- -ions to much action, and is such an event would naturally inter- -fere with any other plans the choir might try to carry out ne- -xt fall I am inclined to beleive, if there are no serious ob- jections, that to grant the use of the building under such  conditions would be the best means of aiding the choir and would be  amply justified from the noble character of the work, our  position in encouraging musical progress,and the scale upon  which it is carried on; all reflecting, indirectly at least, credit  upon our community.  The society would desire the afternnon an and evening the day before conferance, and the first night of  conferance, which I thought might be used in place of our  usual tabernacle choir concert.  I am favorable to such an ar rangement.  Will you bretheren give it your consideration and  inform me at your earliest convenience of your decision  Your Brother, Evan Stephens ENDENTRY Salt Lake City April 10th 1890 President Woodruff and Councilors, Brethren.  In compliance with your suggestion  I called on Attorney Richards relative  to the tabernacle and the Festival.  the substance of his reply was as follows,  that you should not have sent me to them  as you were aware of his opinion in the  matter. which had been the same all the time  since I, five years ago, was refused the  use of the buildings; (unless admission fees  were dispensed with) on the grounds that an  advantage might be taken of it by the  Government if the place was not reserved  exclusively for Religious Worship.  He did not think the admission fee of such  importance now, as that might be arranged, But anything other than Religious worship  ENDENTRY in the building might be construed  unfavorably.  I asked how this could be made consistent  with the fact that the building had been  granted to other parties a number of times  since it was refused me, and the same  explanation ^was^ made to me, and my five hundred  students, five years ago. to which he replied: that his views, and advice, had constantly  been the same; but that you had a perfect  right to take the matter into your own  hands, as you had done in these other  cases, and run whatever risk there was  in using the building as you saw fit. and that there might even be no risk, as other churches sometimes were used for like  purposes. But that from a legal stand- point he was unwilling that in case  of trouble ^that^ he could be blamed for  advising the use of it under any conditions  for anything other than religious Worship. ENDENTRY I regret that I am unable to give any  satisfactory reasons to the society for my  failure to get the use of the building for them, as they were willing to comply with any conditions  upon which others have had it, and doubtless  feel equally deserving in every respect  to anything that has, or may come into  exhistence, in the way of musical organizations.  I admit it looks as if I  was the obstacle  personally, and if so, I am content to step  aside, and resign my position as conductor, if  by ^my^ so doing they can proceed with the glorious  musical work they have begun.  If, under the circumstances, you could  write a letter that I might read to the  Society, that might ^would^ explain matters to  their satisfaction. Showing why It would  greatly oblige me, as it would relieve  me of the apparent blame, or at least  put things in their true light. and put  a stop to much questionings that I know not how to answer. ENDENTRY I have never been appointed to any definite musical work under the special direction or protection  of the church. Still I have spent all my energy,  unsolicitated, to advance the community musically  and felt as if it were my mission just as much  as if I had been set apart for it. So foreign has  it been from my wildest dreams to use my little  talent outside of this community that I would not  even listen to propositions made me while east  whereby I might to the fullest extent bring out  whatever there was in me. My heart was at home,  and I could only eagerly grasp any thing that I  thought would be useful to me after my return. I cannot express to you how discouraged I have  felt though, as one effort after another is annulled  by circumstances over which I have no control Musical Composition was my first Idol. how I  have worked on various subjects peculiar to  our religion to try and express them in  ENDENTRY the melody and harmony that my inner life  seemed to feel. "Restoration of the gospel," "the gathering" "temple work" and scores of like subjects have  been set to music by me. then I have longed  to see a great musical work, (an oratorio) similar to "The Messiah" and like works of  great musical masters made from subjects in  the "Book of Mormon" also, a musical work  on a large scale on the Exodus of the saints tofrom valley.  Of course I know  that such art works must be exclusively for  our own use, but that never discouraged me. But  when I thought of their performance (as every  composer must, as it is the only way to bring his  works to light and bear fruit) I felt the  utter inability of our musical organizations  to do the work. (Much of which I have in  Manuscript in my trunks.) then I set to  work to train the children, all went well ENDENTRY for about four years, during which time I  had over a thousand children in Salt Lake City  able to do better work than could be found even  in artistic and musical Bastors. over two hundred  of them had masterd musical notation so as to read  at sight such music as our tabernacle choir  would use. I could till the ground, but the sunshine must come from public approbation, where  parents might come and be delighted with  their advancement, and the applause from a  delighted audience would gladden their hearts  and fill them with renewed determination to  strive to still advance.  With the closing of  the tabernacle to us this sunshine was shadowed  and I knew my work in that direction was  for the future useless, and though I have done  the best I could since, the training of the  children no longer bears fruit as it did. had there been no interuption, today I might  have had at least fifteen hundred growing  singers, and between five and ten hundred  grown, capable of doing good service, ENDENTRY As it was I next turned my attention to  such of the old students as were eager to  follow up the work under any conditions. so  I labard in a little room on main street  untill I had a class capable of taking  up high class musical dramatic works. By freely  spending my time, (without compensation even),  with those possessing superior voices I got  them by degrees to do work expected only  from proffessionals and even great singers. the result was, My Opera Co. entirely of  our own people.  It was very severe work  upon me, and while I loved the music I did  not love the stage.  then I found that  in their delight over their work and triumph  generally in this direction there was a tendency  to neglect other more important work, and  that others in the field were (perhaps not  without cause) complaining. I disbanded  the company in the midst of their success, and I believe it was for the best good of  all that it should be so. ENDENTRY I wrote showing the nes^e^sisity of a large choral organization. It was organized, Bro Careless was  given charge of it. Later it was thought best to ask me in to assist, and my pupils were also wanted, and  by my advice they all joined, owing to mismangement  it proved impossible to interest the singers  after the first winter, and the society died for want  of singers. I was as helpless as if I did not  belong, as I had no voice in managing matters. Besides our views were entirely different. Bro Careless  was opposed to the young inexperienced singers, while I was eager to see them there to gain  experience. the tabernacle was freely given  for their use, even every expense of meetings  were settled for them by the church. But these  meetings were neither made  attractive nor  instructive. So one by one they remained away untill the 600 members dwindled  down to about 40. ENDENTRY About 600 Books, and four or five hundred  dollars, both lying useless, is all that  remains of the society at present.  The fearful calamity at Johnstown  called forth a gathering of about 400 of  our leading singers. I was chosen conductor  they became quite enthusiastic and  desired to organize into a permanent  society. But owing to an understanding  that it was not desirable for us to meet  or hold forth in the Building the matter  was dropped. Shortly after Mr Gilmore  secured the building, and I was again  engaged to train the chorus.  The former  members quickly rallied and we had  the best body of singers perhaps ever heard  in Utah.  The same desire was still manifest  to organize permanently and finally  The Assembly Hall was granted us. ENDENTRY the fact that the house had been used on  these mentiond occasions gave a general  idea that matters were not in the condition  they were five years ago, or else that  the danger had been exagerated at that  time, gave a general impression that the  house would now be granted the  Society. Those who had interested themselves  successfully in obtaining it for other  occasions freely assured me that they  could get it for us if given charge of  the matter. As I knew of no legitimate  reason why I could not, if they could,  and as I had naturally felt that I had  been discriminated against on the former  occasion, I did not care to place the  matter in any bodys hands.  So came and  presented the matter to you personally, in behalf of the Society.  I have given up all preparations for  the Festival, as I consider the result  equal to a refusal, and were it in my  ENDENTRY power I should not care to press such  a matter in the least, for I should a  thousand times prefer the refusal to  being the possible means of any trouble.  On the other hand I should like the  Society to know that I have done my  simple duty by them. This an explanitory  letter from you would greatly aid me in. Perhaps all is for the best, and when the proper time comes if I have any  good to perform I may be able to  do it. if not, the desire—the plans,  I have laid—the work preparitory  work I have done—the thoughts of what  I might, and would have done will  all have been of some benifit to me  though they bear no other fruit than  self satisfaction.  Pardon me for my lengthy letter.  I felt  as if I must unload myself.  An early reply would greatly oblige  me as the Society meet again Monday   ENDENTRY Yours respectfully  Evan Stephens 850 E. 1st South St ENDENTRY Papeete Tahiti Feb 9. 1898. To the First Presidency Salt Lake City, Utah. Dear Brethiren: I send by the mail a statistical report for the year ending Dec 21, 1896. But it is not complete. In as much as there is nothing on file here to make base a report upon and as the reports required of the branch clerks do not aver many of the pounds called for in the thanks sent me. I would judge that it is the first report of the kind called for from the mission here. I have translated the thank and shall ^endeavor^ to get a complete and correct report for the year ending Dec 31 1897 at as early a date as possible. Owing to the very poor communication we have here it shall al- ways be late in the following year before a ENDENTRY complete report can be given. All is moving well at present. We are having our wet season. Your Brother, DT Miller ENDENTRY Papeete Tahiti Aug 27 1897 To the First Presidency, Salt Lake City, Utah. Dear Brethren: Elders Chipman, McGregor have arrived in good health Elder Chamberlin will leave for Morea tomorrow to open up the work there. Bro. Cropper will take the first vessel for Tubuai Bro I leave for Conference tomor- row. Four elders remain at Tahiti. Upon my return from Conference I shall go to Raiatea with two elders to open up the work in the Leeward group and from there I shall go to Rarotouga, the principal island of Cook Group, with two elders to begin work in that ENDENTRY group. I shall use the two elders hava- rea that I was interesting to use at the Marquisas group. The people at Raiatea are a more promising class than at the Marquisas group, Since peace has been established between ^them^ and the govern- ment are have the same privileges there as else where and ^I^ believe it will be well to be among the first of other denomi nations there. They are all Protestant there at present. I expect to release  elders Smith in  Spring and Despain in the Spring. I would like two elders to sucreed them. I would also like two elders for the Marquisas group and two for the work at the Gambier grant making in all six elders. If you considered it wise for elders to go alone we can economize in elders in the Tuamotu Islands. The ENDENTRY elders will received better treatment from people where there is just one-than where there are two because it is not such an outlay on food. the same will be true in regard to Starting passage on ves- sels. In case of sickness or death it would, of course, be better for two elders to lie to- gether. As it is generally the custom to have two elders go together I not do otherwise there unless you consider it is wise to do so. I have obtained a deed for a piece of ground 20 meters wide by 35 meters long. It is in my name at present as the Church is not liscenced by the govern ment yet. To whom shall I make out the deed? We shall build upon my re- turn from Conference with the rest ENDENTRY of the illegible we are to obtain. Respectfully Your Bro. in the Gospel D. T. Miller ENDENTRY Papeete Tahiti Aug 18 th 1898  To the First Presidency  Salt Lake City Utah  Dear Brethren  Since last writing I have traveled through the Seward group. The elders there are in good health and spirits.  I think that we have good prospects for  getting a branch at Huahine, Borabora,  and Maupiti. Huahine was opened up  Feb 1898 and we now have eleven members. Borabora was opened up in Nov. 1897 and we  now have nine members there. Raiatea was opened up in Sept 1897 and we have five members there. This makes twenty- five for that group. At Borabora the elders feel hopeful that they will have a  following of twenty members by the end  of the year. At Huahine I met quite a number who were favorable but want ed more to consider. Raiatea and Tahas are quite bitter and it will take a  strong effort to make an impression there.  ENDENTRY Of course in the whole group it will take earnest effort to get a following. However I feel hopeful for the prospects there. The people there have been trained in the Protestant faith and know nothing else. It will therefore take time for new ideas to take effect upon them. We are getting  our following from the younger classes principally and I believe that constant effort will finally tell upon the younger generation there who as yet have not  become set in their way of thinking upon religion.  Elders will go to the Cook group and the Marquesas group as soon as they can get passage there.  The elders report twelve baptisms in the Tuamotu group since conference. They come principally from the Josephite  Church. Two baptisms are reported in the  Austral group.  We have commenced the translation of  the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants ENDENTRY The work will move as fast now as we can do justice to it.  Before asking the saints for a donation we feel that we should know more definaitely  what such work will cost. The paging of the  books will be about the same as the English  copy. If there is any difference there will be more in the Tahitian. It will help us in our figures here to know how much 1000, 1500, and 2000 copies of each book will cost. Will a man be called on a mission for the purpose of printing them (If I  remember correctly this was done in the  case of the Hawaiian edition) or will the printer be hired? It will be appreciated to  have the price of paper per cwt and the cost of material for cloth binding, and for the ordinary leather binding in case we have a printer called to help in the printing. If the work is to be let can the work be done  as cheaply at Salt Lake City as it can at San Francisco when we consider the cost of Transportation between Utah and the ENDENTRY coast. I have not felt inclined to ask for figures from any of them without knowing what your desires are in that line.  We have a general idea of what the printing will cost but we will be more satisfied with closer figures on the matter The elders have arrived in good health Bro Wright has bought a set of tools.  costing between $3000 and $40 00/100.  I believe that saints will be quite ready  to help us but of course it will be impossible  to say what sum we can get until it is put to the test. The war is making  some things in the line of food quite high here at present. This will effect the purses of the natives some.  They seemed quite pleased in being able to help on the house here and I expect the same readiness in securing help for publication.  We are all well at present Praying for the blessings of heaven to atend you I am your Brother D.T. Miller. ENDENTRY Pepeete Tahiti, May 14 1898  To the First Presidency.  Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brethren:  Since last writing I have visited Austral group. (Tubuai) The saints illegible do- ing quite well. I found one real good meeting house and a second house quite well illegible in the other branch. This group is the most isolated of any of the groups here. Therefore the people are not so far advanced as in other groups They show, however, considerable love for the gospel. We had a very enjoyable time at confer ence on Takawa Ute had illegible times present from most of the branches. The illegible ENDENTRY their conference on saint island.

I would not be sur prised if we were able to sell quite a large num ber to Josephites illegible would realized by selling them at a reasonable price that to call for a donation for whether illegible as little is donated they will expect the books free. We shall take every effort to make them a fine example of Tahitian literature.  We have been busy the last few weeks in pre- paring the house so as to have it ready to  dedicate on June illegible We are putting illegible sealings and papering the room We have just finished illegible the main room. This next week we shall put up a illegible 12 X 12 for ENDENTRY a cook room and as a sleeping room for elders who will be at the port. This will enable us to  sleep on straw beds instead of the floor as we have been doing.  So far as I can see we are gaining the re- spict of all classes here and trust that as soon as we have the house finished we will be able to do gu work here. illegible the illegible make the lack of houses an excuse for not join- ing us illegible should ^be^ matters of illegible in the near future.

If the next elders coming could bring some tracts in the Hocoara language we can make used. As I am not acquainted with any of the works in that language I can not say what tracts would be best.  I have studied a trifle in the Cook Island tongue and I think that a man who knows Tahitian can learn it in one month.  At Takaroa I met a young man from Wai- quisas and was quite favorably impressed with him. He urged us to go there and thinks that we can make an opening there.  The captain of the Proper Bind says she will not ENDENTRY leave San Francisco until the 8 of Aug.

There are a few small islands that are illegible to the diffirent islands. Our experience has been that we can  do more successful work in new fields when it is so arranged that elders can ENDENTRY stay for several months on one island. I   it see that we can do though and effect we work there will list them are elders at present. It may be that in the course of a few  years fewer elders might do the work there  I am looking for an opportunity to go to the Australia  group.  I believe with energetic work we can get a good following in all of the islands.  We are all well and in good spirits.  Your Brother,  D. T. Miller ENDENTRY Marquises are the least promising of any. In the first two it will be difficult to get a hearing among them. They are only Protestoriales as yet and the min- isters of the Protestant for the taking advantage of this are using every effort to keep other ministers out. I was told by a native from Rurutu a letter is sent by about every vessel to keep our elders out of there and as the natives still make and execute their own laws they will endeavor to have the natives banish us from the island as the church gov- erns the king largely. This difficulty will not be met at Marquises but it will be the moral is addtion of the people. It has been the retreat of ex-gensdannes for many ^years^ who have had a very debasing effect upon the people there. We cannot look for much improvement in this line unless the influence of the gospel does it and how would he as good a illegibleas any to make an effort there.   ENDENTRY I shall feel my way very coutiously all Rimatara out in the other islands mentioned. I shall make efforts to introduce the gospel as fast as elders are furnished one for ^that^ purpose unless other wise instructed. From what I see of the natives we would get many followers, but the influence of ot- her ministers will effect us more or less. Their method seems to be to intimidate the natives so they will not listen to us for fear of excommunication. In fact listening to a Mormon elder is the only "crime" worthy of even the threat of excommunication by the other denominations here. While it is impossible ^to^ illegible their influence against us.

Strenuous efforts were made privately with the Judge, as I am informed, to have my sentence made as light as possible, and a numerously signed petition had been presented to him. To counteract any favorable inclination on the part of the Judge toward me in consequence of this, some other parties appear to have reported to him that I had been zealously in- culcating polygamy until now in my theological instructions in the Academy. As for obvious reasons I have not publicly touched upon these subjects for some time, I protested to the Judge personally against these reports, before opening in of the court. He accepted my statement, as he said, with pleasure. He gave me the longest lecture among all the  rest of the bretheren under the rod that day, and fined me $300 and costs $33. to be committed until the fine was paid. Although I had not ENDENTRY the money, I drew the check on the Bank to escape con- finement in the Penitentiary and interference with my la- bors. The Bank has honored the draft, but I must give my note for the balance ^of^ whichat I cannot pay up today. Some of my friends here, I understand, have started a col subscription to assist me in raising the amount, and even some of my students presented me this morning at the opening exercises with a subscrip- tion list of $1800:  I thanking God for this deliverance, in regard to which I have had my unwavering faith all along, the machinations of the enemies to the contrary not- withstanding. I have been told even that a certain lawyer Sanpete openly boasted that he could furnish the Judge the proofs of 19 young girls from his section of the country alone, that had been seduced in this Academy.  Bro. Marion Tanner has been very kind in taking part of my classes during my recent indisposition, but my health improving rapidly, I am able to at- tend to all duties resting upon me; leaving him to look after his own interests somewhat; he is finan- cially embarrassed and is getting nervous about his prospects. The results of the subscriptions above alluded to I shall report to you in my next.  With kind regards Karl G. Maeser. ENDENTRY PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE  BOARD OF TRUSTEES. A. O. SMOOT, President, H. H.

Dear Brother,  Your letter of April 10, notifying me of my appointment as a mem- ber of the General Board of Education for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints, was received this morning and perused by me with great satisfaction.  For many years has it been the chief aim of my educational ef- forts to formulate a scholastic system founded upon and pene- trated by the principles and spirit of the Latter day Work. These efforts, although enjoying in some measure the approval of the Authorities, have necessarily been confined to a limited sphere and could not claim a general recognition from the church. Your intentions, however, as expressed to me previously, and the steps taken in this regard by the Quorum of the Twelve, unanimously sustained by the General Conference, demonstrate to me the fact, that my hopes for the coming of this eventful epoch in our church history have not been in vain, and I feel almost to exclaim with Simon of old: "O Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, for es. es. es.  Thanking you for the confidence placed in ENDENTRY me by this appointment, which I hereby accept, I can only say, that it shall be my earnest endeavor with the help of God to faithfully perform any duty this new calling may enjoin upon me.

Dear Brother,  Your kind letter of March 6th was duly received, and its contents have been a source of joy and gratitude not  only to me but also to my fellow teachers. It was im- possible for me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter in a satisfactory manner any sooner, as our treasurer was prevented to attend to the proper division of the funds before last Saturday. All the teachers of this Academy join me in expressing to you and the Council of the Twelve our gratitude for the generous  assistance rendered to us.  Saturday, March 10. I was arraigned before the  Court on an indictment for unlawful cohabitation and plead "Not Guilty". The legal council for the defense here stated to me, however, that the Pro- secution had a clear case against me, members of my family having acknowledged the fact before the Grand Jury. Judge Henderson was willing to let me off from imprisonment, though, if I would withdraw my plea of "Not Guilty". He would ENDENTRY only fine me, if I would show no fight, which were hopeless anyway and only increase the costs. And as there is a strong feeling even among the leading Gentiles here against my conviction, and I understand that they even are circulating a petition to the Judge. I, there- fore, plead "Guilty" last Saturday withe the distinct understanding that there shall be no imprisonment in my case, and no promise to obey the law required. The decision will be rendered next Saturday, Ma^r^ch 24.  Bro. Marion Tanner has taken several of my classes as stated before, which gives me time to the general records, and diagrams, and plans in order to put every thing in good order in this Academy, preparatory to any emergency. If you should desire me to do anything outside of this Academy, or to quit temporarily or otherwise for any purpose I shall be ready to respond. Things could go on here satisfactorily enough, I think, from next Monday commencing.  My health is slowly improving under the par- tial relief which I now enjoy. I succeeded in indu- cing my son Reinhard, Principal of the Beaver Stake Academy, to withhold his resignation from his position, which would cause a collapse of the institution. I told him that a general organization was in contemplation, and he will stand at his post, until that time.  With gratitude, Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser. ENDENTRY Maeser, Karl G.

And consulting with my fellow-teachers of this Ac- ademy, and Bro W. W. Cluff, chairman of the Ex. Com.,  in regard to your father counsel of my taking a rest  for a little while and have Bro. J. M. Tanner take  my place in the meantime, I have to state, that these  bretheren fully realize the necessity of some relaxation  for me, but that in consideration of the Normal Grad- uates preparing now for their final examination, it  would be a serious detriment for them, if I should  withdraw now entirely.  In as much as Bro. Tanner was  willing to take classes of minor importance off my  hands, I ought to finish up the course with these  Normals in Theory, Practice, and Theology, and at- tend to the general executive matters among the stu- dents, giving me thus sufficient chance to keep up  until vacation, when I could take a complete rest.  Appreciating, on the one hand, the importance of your ENDENTRY ^counsel^ and the kind feelings which dictated it, I comprehend,  on the other also, the motives of my bretheren here, in desiring me to remain to the end of the term, in part at  least. As I always have endeavored to carry out cheer- fully every counsel received from the servants of God,  I leave the final decision in this matter with you, and  shall abide by it whatever it is.  Bro. H. H. Cluff, the treasurer of the B. Y. Academy,  tells me that he is forwarding to you a complete state- ment of the financial status of the institution, and  desired me to simply refer you to that report. There  are, how er, a you points of explanation which may  not appear in his paper, I and I respond, therefore,  to your request in the following manner:  it was agreed between the Board and the Faculty  before the beginning of the schoolyear, that one of our  member, Bro. G. B. Keeler, should act as Deputy Treasurer,  collect the tuition and pay the teachers pro rata as the  funds came in, after deducting 2 1/2% for the Board  for the regular expenses, viz: Rent, Fuel es. es.  Balances left unpaid to be settled some future time. Since that  arrangement Bro. Talmage was reengaged with $1200  and his salary raised after a few weeks to $1400.  This made the deficit of each teacher still larger,  falling very heavy upon the younger members of the  faculty,  whose salary is scarcely above their board,  ENDENTRY PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE  BOARD OF TRUSTEES.

I prayed fervently to my heavenly father that if it was ^his^ will, that he should turn her heart to me, if not that he would cause me to forget her I could not forget Clara, and it is with a what I thought long delay my prayers were fulfilled. Once when I was feeling rather down, Sister Zina D. Young told me not to feel bad and if Clara was Miss Right it would all  come about in time. I thinknow that she is the Miss. Right. Since Clara told me of her love for me. I seem to be loving a new life, and every thing seems to be brighter before me. Accept the few lines from Your Brother in the gospel of Christ. O. C. Beebe. ENDENTRY Private To be read only by Father and Mother Woodruff  Liverpool 4th Decr 1845  Dear Mother  We once more call your attention  to the perusal of a sheet from us. It is now a long time since we heard from you. We have felt very anxious to know how you were in health and circumstances. My main object in writing to you at this time is to lay before you my mind and and feelings on certain subjects and to make some proposals to you. You are of course well apprised of the continued persecution of  the Saints in Illinois and their expectation to emigrate en masse next May to California where they can be out of the reach of the Persecution of the United States and form a colony of their own. It is true, in accomplish- ing this they have to make a sacrifice of much pro- perty in Nauvoo, but I have no doubt it will work together for the good of the people and the more fully establishing of the Kingdom that the Law of God may go forth of Zion and they be enabled to fulfil the expectations of the Ancient Prophets. We as a  people have borne the oppression of the United States quite as long as the Lord requires it of us, and the word is now "Save thyself. O Zion that dwellest with the Daughter of Babylon" and "Come out of her my people that ye receive not of her sins. and partake not of her plagues." The Cup of the Iniquity of the ENDENTRY American Nation is full no doubt, heavy judgments day over her, and among others. I believe ther is nigh even at her doors.  England is making great preparations for war.  Twice I learned of the determinatin to remove from Nauvoo- I have meditated much about your Situation and have tried to learn what the will of the Lord is concerning my duty towards you, and inasmuch as you are member's of the church and deserted by all around you I have not felt willing in my own mind neither could I see it to be my duty to go out of the midst of that nation without giving you an opportunity of going out with us. I expect that nearly the whole church will leave the United States either by land or water. Some of the Saints are going from New York with their printing press by way of Cape Horn to California. The Emigration hereafter from the Country will be carried on by the same west.  The Saints in their land are expecting to purchase some ships for that purpose.  It will be about 70 days sail from here.  As our affairs are unsettled in Nauvoo and having one child there and one in Maine and on your account also we concluded to return by way of United States and gather up our family and take you along with us if you will go and accompany the Camp of the Saints in  their going forth out of Babylon.  This may at the first view look to you to be a hard task but feel it will be no worse than it will be to ENDENTRY remain behind and have no soul to comfort or console you in your declining years.  I am expecting to leave here for New York about the 1st of January.  I purpose to call upon you on my way to Maine where I shall go to get our little girl and return to Connecticut.  I then intend to get a good warm Covered wagon and horses and take you along with me to Nauvoo by so doing you will have the pri- vilege of leaving the people in Farmington who are not worthy of your labours and also of visiting the Temple in Nauvoo and getting you endowment before we take our departure from Babylon in the Camp of the Saints which will be as interesting a body as ever moved since the day Moses led Israel out of Egypt. and you will also have the privilege of enjoying the Society of some of your children during your last days.  I expect to come prepared to accomplish this object and I hope you will incline your mind to Comply with the request. if so.  I wish you to begin to prepare yourselves immediately on the reception of this letter. by.collecting in any moneys that may be due you as far as you can.  You need not reveal your intention to any person unless you see it absolutely necessary.  I would rather not have this letter read to any but yourselves till you see me which will probably be about the fore part of February( if the Lord will) My labours and cares are very great here. but I am settling my business as fast as possible.  We are all enjoying good health at the present time. Phebe joins me in love to you both.

We have the drafts of the Temple Tower from Architect Folsom, sent the Bills of Tim- bers and Lumber to the Mount Trumbull Mill and the sawing was mostly done last au- tumn, but we have not all the hauling done yet. At the Stake Priesthood Meet- ing in June a call was made upon the Wards of this Stake for teams to  finish that hauling. The Bishops were evidently willing and will no doubt move in the matter as soon as the hot weather moderates, and the summer work is somewhat out of the way.  We have no word relative to the Engine House and Cook and Eating House. The last I heard relative to those improvements was when in Salt Lake City last April; when their location, plan and size were referred to Brothers Erastus Snow and Wm. H. Fol- som. These brethren were to consider the matter and, as I understood it, were then ENDENTRY to report the result of their consultation to the Presidency and Twelve.  Brother Erastus Snow went to the  Temple yesterday, and we again took the measurements of distance between water tower and Temple andc., andc., and talked over the most suitable location for the Engine House and Cook and Eating House.  In consequence of the Water Tower being on the North side of the Temple, the talk generally has been, that it would be best to build the Engine House andc adjoining. But it has always been admitted that the  more we built on the North side the more the full view of the Temple from the North or place of approach would be obstructed. Now if we had the water conveyed in pipes from the recently pur- chased spring we would have no use for the Water tower, and the Engine House and other contemplated buildings could be put on the South side and the Water tower could be removed, leaving an unobstructed ENDENTRY view of the Temple from the North.  Should the Engine be put on the South side of the Temple, the present system of piping and radiators for heating the building need not be changed.  Relative to funds for making these improvements, we have in Sa U. T. O.  Cash $19500 Flour 49 sacks Wheat 80 Bus. Barley 300 lbs Hay 40 Tons, Wine 3000 Gal. Canaan a/c meat $7,60000  We have no Home Made Goods; our Washington Factory a/c being at present overdrawn some $30000  The current tithing of course keeps coming in, but is drawn out on a/cs. Current about as fast as received.  As soon as we learn where it is de- cided to erect the buildings, we will use what labor and other tithing we have at command to get the material and haul it there ready for the builders.  The Artists, Christian- sen, are getting along nicely. They have the East and South walls finished, and are working on the North and West walls.  Brother McAllister will be here the 14th or 15th of this month; he is now visiting ENDENTRY the settlements up the Rio Virgen; was well the last word I received.  We are always very glad to get a word from you or any of the brethren who preside over us, to aid us in the discharge of our duty  God bless you, Sir, and all of your Co-workers in Zion's cause  Is the prayer of yours in the Gospel  James G. Bleak. ENDENTRY St George, 26th July 1880.  To  President W. Woodruff. Salt Lake City.  My dear Brother,  Last Saturday  evening's Mail brought me Architect Folsom's Bill of Timbers and Lumber required for St George Temple Tower. To- morrow morning we forward it to the Nixon Saw Mill at Trumbull. Bro. Folsom promised the Plan and Dotails at his earliest convenience. He states in his communication that there will be required for the Tower: Two Boxes Best Leaded Roofing Tin and Solder for some; Also 200 feet of 3/4 In. Round Iron for Bolts.  The Bill of Timber and Lumber feets up twenty three thousand two hundred and nineteen feet.  I have asked M P. Romney to make an estimate of the nails required. He presents the following: 4 Kegs of 8d, 2 Kegs of 10d, 1 Keg of 12d ENDENTRY I Keg of 6d 2 Kegs of Spikes and 1 Keg (100lbs) of finishing 8d. This will make a total of 1100 nails.  If the Roofing tin - Round Iron and Nails are sent to the and of the Track we will see to the hauling from there to the Temple.  I have been to see how the work is giving on in the ink blot—Room in the Temple as far as done it looks very nice, smooth the plasters told me they would be out of there in three days. I think it will  please you and the brethren when you come down. We have heard nothing of the Artists. But have supposed they wished not to start before your 24 July Celebration.  The work of cleaning up and renova- ting is getting along nicely. Bro Winsor and other brethren begin putting down the carpets up stairs in the Temple on next Thursday. Thompson has nearly finished the remodeling and improving of the heat rediating pipes. The heating surface is much enlarged. ENDENTRY According to programme, Bro McAllis- ter is to make a trip from Pinto to-day to Iron City and return to Pinto. From Pinto to Parowan thence to Pangwich where he expects to be next Saturday 31st.  We had a very peaceful good spirited celebration of "Pioneer Day." It  was a time of rejoicing. I enclose you a Programme of proceedings. The health of the peopel is reasonably good. The heat is somewhat oppressive. At half past One yesterday morning I got up and looked at my thermo- meter and it was at 90° at nearly the same hour this morning it was 88°. The Thermometers in town in the day- time vary from 102° to 114° in the shade, according to location.  We very much need more water on this St George slope, without an increase of water for irrigation St George has ^attained^ its growth.  With kind regards I remain Yours in the Gospel  James G. Bleak.

Some little time ^ago^ the Canaan Board passed a resolution to cease paying out any more  live stock on Capital Stock  A/C. As quite a number of heavy stock-holders had drawn out their amount in live stock to send over  to Arizona and elsewhere, thus leaving a heavy propor- tionate amount of the property of the Courts any in Real Estate. In con- sequence of this, and the scattered state of the herd at this time of year, and  ENDENTRY as some of the herd hands had been discharged for the winter months, it was thought by the board of di- rectors that they could not fill do anything to- wards filling the order of the 200 Cows and the 70 steers. The substance of this was telegraphed to President Taylor, and a letter explaining the cause of not turning out the Cattle was promised. President Taylor sent a reply to know what could be done towards filling the order stating the stock was much needed to send South. Another Board meeting was  called and the Resolution referred to was rescinded and steps at once taken to set the cows if possible ENDENTRY by the time, but it was  doubted by the Board that they could get the steers as there are comparatively few in the herd.  Yesterday, the Board engaged Bro James Andrus, former Supr of Canaan, to go out and aid the present Supr in gathering the Stock that is the Cows, and if possible the  steers. Telegraphic message sent last night to the pres- ent Superintendent to meet Andrus with what hands and saddle horses he had  and to make the drive.  We trust the brethren, will be successful in gathering so as to fill the order; but the time is  short and because of the fall of snow the stock is scattered away from ENDENTRY their usual watering places. We feel assured the breth- ren will do their very best to gather the amount of Cows and if possible the  steers required.  In relation to directing the imigration to St John, you shall have our cordial co- operation.  Trusting Sister Phebe will  continue to improve, and feeling pleased and thankful that you have recovered from your cold and that you are so well in health  We remain as ever  Yours in the Gospel  John D.

Salt Lake City, Dearly Beloved Brother,  This wonderful day for Isreal, the Annointing of the Martr- dom of Hyrum, was  drated possibably in St George Temple.  Notwithstanding the very busy time of year there were 61 Males and 121 fe- males prequested themselves this morning for the purpose of officiating for and  in behalf of the dead of the Smith family. Brother John L. Smith first con- sin of the martyrs had a record from which the names were furnished. They were mostly Lymans relatives of the maternal side of the George A. Smith, and John L. Smith family, as we did not have names of those bearing any  closer relation to Bro's Joseph and Martyers The Free Will Offering of the people to-day was, however, made to Martyers The day has been a glorious one; the good spirit of the Almighty was most freely powred out; the performance of the holy labor brought its own ENDENTRY reward with it.  Previous to offering the morning prayer Presidnet McAllister read from the Book of Covenants the Address of the  Prophet Nauvoo bearing date of 1st Sept 1842; also his Address to the same under date of 6th Sept. 1842. The place, the seasons and the spirit present, all combined to make the readings unusually impressive. Af- terward the Revelation on the Eternity of the Marriage Covenant was read.  We have had joy in our labors this day, and are assured in our spi- rits that our work is accepted.  We and co-laborers in the Temple join in kind love to you and to the brethren with you.

As the XII academic year of the Brigham Young Ac- ademy closes Friday, May 25 and the Normal Graduates,  10 in number, besides several students graduating in  some scientific studies, are engaged next week in  their written examinations, and these labors besides  the closing xexercises of the Academy requiring my  personal attendance, I cannot see the possibility  of my f complying with this kind invitation.  These circumstances prevent me also to my sore  disappointment to attend the dedication of the  Manti.  As soon I am at liberty in Provo, I shall be  entirely at your disposal. Although the full ENDENTRY amount of labor connected with my present position has fallen upon me again, as Bro. Tanner had to go to Logan for the last few weeks in order to make himself acquainted with his prospective field of labor, my health has been holding out much bet- ter than I expected, until a day or two ago, when it commenced telling on me again.

Dear Brother,  Immediately after my return to Provo, last Tuesday evening, I reported to Bro. A. O. Smoot, President of B.Y.A. Board of Trustees, the decision of the General Board of Education in regard to  my continuing for the present as Principal of the B.Y.Acad= emy subject to the call of the General Board sooner or  later to assume the active duties of General Superintendent  of the Churchschools, and that Bro. Talmage was to be  at once to be transferred to the Salt Lake Stake Academy,  ^and that^ the Board of which would be instructed to make their  own financial arrangements with the Professor.  President Smoot received my communication with  satisfaction expressing the hope that I would not be called  away during the coming academic year.  He appointed  at once Wednesday, July 11, evening, for the meeting of  the Board of the Academy.  A Quorum being present  at the appointed hour, the points concerning Bro. Tal= mage and myself, as stated above, were taken in the  Minutes, the manuscript for the new Circular sub= ENDENTRY mitted, discussed, and adopted, and I was instructed to give  as extensive publicity to definite arrangement as possible. Bro. Talmage is now anxiously waiting for the official com= munication from the S.L.Academy Board.  I took the lib= erty of asking Bro. Talmage for the names of those "high in  authority" that advised him to go to the University, and he  said that Chancellor P. G. Whitney did not know anything  of it, but that other members of the Regency, who were in the  church, made the offer and adding, that this offer would hold good for another year yet.  In as much as Bro. Talmage has been  taken away from this Academy, and in consequence of it the  labors of my fellowteachers and myself will be considerably  increased, besides that it will be necessary to increase my cor= respondence greatly in order to get our schurchscool move= ment under way in some shape, and my official letters  should be copied, I should be very grateful if some kind  of a copying arrangement could be placed at my dis= posal.  My fellowteachers here are in high glee over my re= maining with them, and I only hope, that under God's blessing my physical strength may prove equal to my  good will to serve in my Master's Cause as long my  day shall last.  May God strengthen you in your heavy responsibilities is the  prayer of Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser. ENDENTRY Board of Trustees A. O. Smoot, President H. H. Cluff, W. H. Dusenberry, M.

Cannon of the same date came to hand yesterday and contents ^were^ carefully con- sidered. If in my letter to Pres. Cannon of the 11th and to you of the  12th, or at any other time or occasion I have appeared to you too presumtuous in manifesting my anxiety for the development  of the glorious educational movement contemplated by you and the Quorum of the Twelve, and ^in^ assuming the initiation in proposing items when I should have waited for instructions, I pray to kindly overlook it for this once, for it shall be hence- forth my earnest solicitude to watch the brakes.  Bishop Schoenfeld spoke to me also about the necessity of a  new ^German^ edition of the Book of Mormon in conformity with the English translation, and told me he was going to lay the  matter before you. The German translation cannot be im- proved as much I now can recolect, having read it in  German several times, but not much since 1870, when I returned from my German mission. But the paragraphing in accordance with the new English edition with  The references as will take some time and requires care- ENDENTRY ful comparing. Since the office of General Supt. of Church  School is for the present a mere nominal one, by putting in every day at an average an hour and a half extra work I  think I can do it, and submit the work for approval to a Committee from time to time for approval. Said  Committee to consister perhaps of Bros. Edward Schoenfeld, Schettler, and Dr. Isaacson. If this plan should meet your  approval, I should lose no time to but commence at once.  In connection with this subject, permit me to state some of my experience in teaching the Book of Mormon. I have  felt for many years that we are sadly in need of a historical  extract of the Book of Mormon, in plain III Reader Style in which  the language of the Book itself is held; in short chapters with  charactersitic headings easily to be remembered by the children.  Further, I have felt also that we need illustrations of the prin- cipal scenes of the Book of Mormon, in order to popularize it  for 27 illustrations of this kind, which would be a fine beginning. These illustrations should be approved of by you first though, to prevent wrong impressions to be created among the youth.  May God sustain you in these trying times, is the prayer  Your brother in the Gospel  Karl G. Maeser. ENDENTRY PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE  BOARD OF TRUSTEES. A. O. SMOOT, President, H. H. CLUFF, W. H.

Dear Brother,  Your telegram, instructing me to withouthold my resigna= tion for the present, was received last Friday evening, and your  letter of June 26, concerning Bro. Talmage's probable call to  the Salt Lake Academy, likewise the letter of June 29, in  answer to my note submitting to you copy of resignation, were received Saturday morning.  In regard to the call of Bro. Talmage to the S. L. Stake Acade= my, I have felt the wisdom of that move from the moment  that I was informed of it at our last meeting; but as then no immediate prospects presented themselves of having that  plan put into execution, and the B. Y. Academy, after  my removal, needed some one to preside over it, it was  natural for me, to suggest the temporary arrangement, which I took the liberty of laying before you; the more  so, as Bro. Benj. Cluff, for various reasons, would not be  well qualified to take charge of the institution, or any  other for that matter, immediately after his return.  The reason for my concern in regard to my re= signation being handed in on June 30, was, that on that   ENDENTRY day, according to the By-Laws of the B.Y.A., the annual Boad meeting  is to be held, on which among other things the manuscript for the  new Circular is to be discussed and ordered to be printed, and the corps of teachers with the salary for each for the  ensuing year to be determined.  No Quorum being present  last Saturday, an adjourment was taken until today at  4 P.M., when probably another adjournment will have to  be made, owing to the undefined condition of the Faculty,  and the consequent changes in the Circular, the manuscript  of which was ready for adoption on the basis of the temporary  arrangement suggested to you.  Talmage,  and he, of course, is ready to respond to your call at once;  but Pres. Smoot and the bretheren, composing our Prayercircle,  to whom Bro. Smoot desire your letter of the 26th, to be read also, are in a state of consternation.  I prefer, however, that Bro. Smoot himself communicate to you his and  their views.  As the time for opeining the schoolyear is fast ap= proaching, and letters of inquiry are arriving here daily  like flakes in a snowstorm, students being anxious to  know what arrangements they shall make, and I should  be on the move to carry out the instructions, which  in consideration of the pressure of the circumstances, you have to give me, I beg of you, to call the General Board together at your earliest convenience, in order to  ENDENTRY BOARD OF TRUSTEES.

Dear Brother,  Immediately after my return to Provo last week I reported  in duty bound my appointment to the general supervision of  the churchschools to President A. O. Smoot.  Although regretting  my recall from the B. Y. Academy he felt to sustain your  action in the matter, only being deeply concerned about my  successor.  In conferring after this interview with Bro. James  E. Talmage, who had just returned from his weddingtrip to  Manti, I found him entering with heart and soul into  the movement and placing himself unreservedly at your  disposal.  Then I told him of the plans in contemplation  concerning him, that he probably may be called to the  Salt Lake institution to take charge of the Scientific  Department there.  As the teachers of the B. Y. Academy, with whom also I have held a meeting, have not  sufficient confidence in the ability of Bro. Benj. Cluff  to take charge at once as Principal of the B. Y. Academy,  and the present frame of mind of Bro. Cluff in regard to his coming home just now is not known, (he  does not think himself safe for a year or two longer) ENDENTRY they suggested that Bro. Talmage might take charge as temporary  Principal, until he should be wanted at Salt Lake, which would  not be right away, no suitable arrangements for a scientific  department having be made there as yet.  Bro. Cluff could  come home, (family arrangements being ^to be^ made here previous- ly), and labor as a teacher here in his branches under Bro. Talmage for awhile, until he works himself in again. I have given these points much reflection, and have  made temporary arrangements with Bro. Talmage to that  effect subject to your approval.  The annual board mee- ting of the Trustees of the B. Y. Academy takes place Saturday,  June 30, when I shall hand in my letter of resignation;. With thise exception of this last named duty all my work at this Academy is now done, and I am waiting for your  instructions in regard to the new sphere of action which  your confidence has opened before me.  Ever praying for your continued welfare and that  of the bretheren with you I remain  With kind regards  Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser.  P.S. Bro. David John, father-in-law of Bro Benj.

Anticipating my probable withdrawal from the B. Y. Acad- emy, I had fixed up a private study room in my own home,  where I can work without interruption whenever I chose.  This will enable me under the present state of affairs, to spend any convenient time before and after school hours in my  studyroom, and as I cannot be without work I may at- tend to the edition of the German Book of Mormon as well as to any other mental labor. As my own German B of M.  is too dear to me through many reminiscenses since 1853, as that I could ^spoil it^ by the unavoidable process of paragraphing 55 illegible. Would you kindly give me the privilege of getting one  in the Deseret News office for that purpose?

Dear Brother, Relying upon your kind indulgence for not waiting for your  decision in regard to my letter of the 2nd inst., I feel that I am under  the necessity of making some report to you that may constitute a  factor in your consideration of the educational movement, at least  as far as the S.L.

Talmage, on returning from Salt Lake this morning,  informed me, that the offers, made to him by the University of Deseret  a year ago, had been repeated very urgently and seconded by bretheren  high in authority, and accompanied by fine pecuniary induce= ments.  He seemed to consider these propositions quite favorably,  promising me, however, not accept any call from that quarter  in preference to any appointment by the General Board of  Education.  But he requested me to see, if the matter concerning  his position and pecuniary consideration could not be  speedily settled, that he could make his arrangements ac= cordingly.  This matter seemed to me of sufficient importance to acquaint  you with it, that you may know what efforts the University is  making to prevent the establishment of an efficient competition; ENDENTRY besides other features suggesting themselves in consequence of this  report.

Thanks to President Tay- lor and yourself and the  brethren for the grant of sup- plies. The orders will no doubt arrive in due time stating what offices we are to  draw grain from. I wrote a letter to President  Taylor explaining about ENDENTRY our hauling of potatoes from the North while the weather was good.  You ask how many Car- penters are at work on the Tower. There are nine be- sides the superintendent Bro Allman; there are also engaged on the tower six Riggers, Hoisters and Winch men. To-day they have but the seventh-forty two feet tim- ber in its place havin but one more in the lower tier to be placed up- right. The other timbers are all ready to put in place. The mouldings have nearly all been got out.  Relative to Bro Barnes he felt he would rather not work at the framing and rough work, but expects to begin next  week on the siding and ENDENTRY will continue till the work  is done.  The wages of the Temple tower hands for November is Nine hundred and thirty one dollars not including Superintendent Allman's compensation, nor Black - Smith, Tinner nor other wages. I see no reason now why the erection should not steadily continue un- til completed . We have been blessed with very nice weather - the first and only rain since taking down  the old tower was yes- terday morning and then it was but a slight drizzle for a very short  time.

To President Woodruff,  Salt Lake City  My dear Brother,  Elder Thomas Allman arrived by stage last night. I had an interview with him this morning and found he had no plans from Brother Folsom. While at Folsom he was given to understand the plans were here, that they were sent last Fall.  We gathered from your letter that Brother Allman would be here and bring the plans with him, supposing of course that the plan would embody some changes as the result of the the further consultation which President Taylor and yourself— had with Brother Folsom.  Prest. Mc Allister telegraphed to Bro Folsom that Allman was here but had no plans with him.  Bro. Folsom telegraphed as answer ENDENTRY that the plans were sent last Fall. Those plans had been submitted to Prest Taylor and yourself here, last November, by Brother McAllister, since which time I have not seen them. Brother McAllister looked in his desk in the Temple for them and they were not to be found. Brother David H. Cannon and Brother Thompson said they were looked at by Prest Tay- lor at Rockville after he left here last November, and the presumption was that they must have been taken to the City. Word to this effect was sent to Brother Folsom. But very shortly after Brother Thompson found them in his possession and telegraphic word was immediately sent to Bro. Folsom. Who replied there was no other plan and that Bro. Allman understood the suggested changes. This was ^answer^ now in Brother Allman's hands with the plans and specifications of Tower and Tem- ple Addition. So he begins tomorrow morning.  With kind regards to you and all I remain your Brother James G. Bleak. ENDENTRY  27th June 1882.  To President Woodruff,  Dear Brother,  We have not received the Round Iron for Bolts for Tem- ple Tower, nor the Roofing tin, solder, andc, referred to in my letter to you of 26th July 1880. Of course the delay in doing the work has caused the non-filling of the Bill. But now Brother Allman is ready.  Brother Folsom did not make out any Bill for the nails but I got Brother Miles P. Romney to make an estimate as set forth in my letter above referred to and Brother Allman says it is as near as he can estimate.  I will make out a separate bill so that you can use it if you deem it advisable to present to the Trustee in Trust. We have received the nails ENDENTRY trimmings and so on for the addition The building is being laid out by the masons. the digging of the footing for foundation stones will be started in a day or so.  Teams are quite scarce to do work of hauling, but we intend laying the matter before the Stake Priesthood meeting this week and hope to get e- nough.  Weather is very warm 94° in the shade to day. At 8 o'clock last night it was 80°.  If you get the order filled for the Tower—Iron, nails, andc and shipped to Milford we will see to the  freighting from there  Your Brother in the Gospel  James G.

Dear Brother,  As we have not received any word relative to some of the city I have thought it advisable to drop you a line to bring them before your mind.  One was relative to an Order from the Twelve in Trust on the Washington Factory to liquidate our Temple and Su U. Tiths of fice A/c. The letter broachinng this was left in the hands of Brother Nuttall.  Another was permission from the Trus- tee in Trust to apply labor on the Waterknolls near the Spring recently purchased for the Temple.  We were up in the Temple Tower yes- terday and find that the lower octagon framework which is supposed, in Bro Fol- som's plan for the improved tower, to be in already, does not exist at all. There are but the four corner timbers in the lower, floor of the square of the tower or in other words on a level with the roof. We ENDENTRY want if allowable to have Bro Folsom come here, if he can be spared from Manti for a few days, then i can see for himself He could join you and the brethren at Isiah if you would apprize him of the time.  We have quiet peaceful work in the  Temple companies small, found all things satisfactory on my return.  Brothers David H. join in love, and indeed all affectionately  inquire after you.

Dear Brother,  Your favor, announcing your approval of the names  of the ten Beneficiaries for the Church appropriation, has  been received, for which many thanks.  Our Academy commenced August with 121  students, the largest opening we have had since the  fire, and we have reached up to 155.  Bro. Millard  Stake Academy at Fillmore, called on me today in  matters of his Academy. He is on his way to Salt  Lake for the purpose of seeking an interview with  you to lay the affairs of his institution before you  and get some instructions. As Bro. Greenwood  is the first Principal of any Stake Academy star ted outside of the B.Y.A. and one of my own  educational sons, I recommend him to your  kind considerations.  Bro. Stewardson, of Benjamin called me  one day before yesterday desiring me to furnish  a Principal for a Church academy to be  ENDENTRY started in Old Mexico. As I do not know by what  authority Bro Steward speaks, and I have received  no instructions from you to that effect, I ahve  not given him any answer.  The brethren from Franklin have written  to Bro. Newton Hayes, whom I have suggested  as Principal for this Academy, that they would  not be ready for him until late in the fall.  Bro Hayes was not able to wait so long, and has  accepted a situation at the Salt Lake Stake  Academy.  The Stake Board of Bear Lake Stake, some time  ago wrote to me for a Principal of the Academy at Paris, and I recommended to them Prof. Hauisk, a convert of Bro. Hart, recently arrived from Roch;  ester. Bro Hauisk went, but only to find out after  his arrival there, that they could offer him only  about $20 00/ per month, all told. He is now back in  Salt Lake. If this affair has not two side, I do not  comprehend the Bear Lake Authorities.  Ever praying for your welfare and that if  the brethren with you I remain.

Dear Brother,  Your favor of the 24. inst. has just come to hand and con- tents carefully noted.  Enclosed please find letter from Bro. James G. Bleak.  As  Bro. Nephi Savage has not been heard from, I should certainly en= dorse most cordially the nomination of Bro. Edward H. Snow, as  a very worthy candidate for that position.  Bro. Snow is intellec= tually ahead of Bro. Savage, but when he was here he lacked come= what in discipline, and I was informed he was engaged in surveying, or else I should have suggested him for St. George in the first place.  As I do not know the location of the new  contemplated Academy-building there, nor the extent of  the work and patronage expected in that institution I can  not yet draw up specifications for the building, which  I am willing to do as soon I get some of those essential  items.  Bro. Don Carlos Young drew up a beautiful design for the future Provo Academy-building  according to my specifications and ideas, and I  should recommend him to you for all such work  in the future.  I leave the answer to Bro. Bleak's letter  ENDENTRY in your hands.  The Board of Education of Oneida Stake through this Secp Bro. Smart wrote to Bro. Newton Noyes that they would not be ready before late in the fall.  Bro. Noyes could not afford to wait for such an uncertainty and accepted the call to the Salt Lake Stake Academy as one of their teachers.  Bro. Smart has written since to me, stating that in consequence of Bro. Noyes' declining,  one of my Graduates, Bro. Samuel Cornwall, had applied  for the positive.  Although I should have not recommended Bro. Cornwall for that important work, as he is deficient in some points, there being none else anymore that I  am acquainted with at disposal just now, and Bro.  Cornwall is a faithful Latterday Saint, and a competent teacher for the work of Primary and Intermediate Grades,  I have not apposed his application; telling the Board in my letter, that as soon the General Board would assume active apirations the affairs of the verjeus Stake Academies would receive the most careful attention.  Next Monday the Salt Lake Stake Academy commences the new schoolyear under Bro. Talmage's principleship, as I started that institution, I should be happy to attend the opening. But I  cannot leave here even for one day unless I am cabled by you. We have reached bow the number of 167 students,  the greatest attendance at this time of the year, we have ever had.

It would have taken 70 bush of wheat to have paid for that ox besides the  hauling it to Salt Lake City My son lost  the best ox we ever had a short time after  which left me without a team again. The  Saleratus has eaten up my crops for 3 suceeding summers and having to purchase my bread stuff  it has brought me to the lowest to get my  family 11 in number bread to sustain life.  My prayers have ascended to heaven for the  lord to soften your heart ever since I bought  the ox, and I should have raized you the money  last fall but my bishop called on me  ENDENTRY for a team to send back to help the Emigrates I had then to purchase a team with the money I  intended to pay you with I should have paid  you this spring but I had to take every grain I could spare to buy my Eldest boy a team he has statd with me untill he is 21, and is  a good faithful boy. I now have the promise  of getting labor for the boys at the point of  the mountain and as soon as I get that money  you shall have it without delay. I wrote  and sent you a letter by Brother Wm Follet  which told you all particulars about my  afairs. I wrote it 12 months ago but I  have been informed since that he lost the  letter so that you never got it.

Ray March 23, 1887  Salt Lake City Mar 23 1887  Louis Allen  Dear Bro, Your letter of Mar 18th came to hand yesterday. you have a correct understanding of  the situation of the Maricopas Papagos. The Maricopa and Pimas located on Salt  River at Jonesville, are about equel in number. There is quite a number of Papagos among them. The Maricopas are a  Branch of the Yumas situated in Southern Cal- ifornia and western Arizona They number about 3250 on Salt river, at Jonesville and at Phoenix. The Yumas and ENDENTRY Co-Co-pas, and relative tribes that speak the Maricopa Tongue, number about 3,000 or more. The Pimas on Jonesville number about 200. oOne the  north side of the river opposite Jonesville there is a village numbering over 500 Pimas. aAt both of these places there is quite a number of Papagos.  oOn the Pima Reservation  20 miles south of Mesa there is a little above 6,000 Pimas, of this number about 200 hundred are Papagos. South of the Pima reservation the Papogo settlements begin. They extend through Sonora, Mexico, as far as Hermosillo the Capital of Sonora. ENDENTRY They ^Papagos^ number ^about^ 40,000 ^souls.^ fFrom the southren boundry of  the Papago Settlements the Yaquis begin. nNearly all of the Yaquis and Papagos speak, and a great many read and  write spanish. There seems to be a wide difference in opinion as to the number of yaquis and Mayos there are in Mexico. They are the same tribe taking their names from the respective rivers on which they live the Mayos are situated  about one hundred miles south of the yaquis. iIt is  held by some that the two tribes (Yaquis and Mayos) togother number about 150,000 by others not so many. There is a good field for missionaries ENDENTRY among the yaquis in Northern Sonora and by converting these, through them it will be an easy matter to reach the main body of the yaqui tribe, but great care must be exercised as the mexican are very suspicious and  jealous. the catholic priests have little or no influe influence over these people and they will not be hard  to get at, with the Gospel. They can only be reached from the north as it is not practic- able to cross over ^the Sierra Madre Mts^ from where our people are located in Chihuahua. You can see from the situation of these tribes and from their numbers what a great field of labor there is in this country directly south of us, and in my ENDENTRY opinion they are ready and willing to recieve  the Gospel, when ever it is taken to them, and we ^have^ so few elders that can speak the Spanish Tongue now that we ^have^ the Gospel in their own languages. aAnd there seems to be very little  interest in the matter here in I think if a number of our young  men should be called to study the spanish in the  wards and stakes of the Church and take this as a mission that they would take hold of it and in a short time there would be plenty of young elders to carry the Gospel to the Lamanites, for if they should all be baptized  ENDENTRY in ^a^ body without waiting  to be taught the Gospel, they would need a great amount of Teaching and instruction to prepare them for the work before them and for their Temple work. Of the chiefs that visited Salt Lake City with Bro Rogers and myself, Usavia and Pimas, Cheroqius Erastus were Valenzuela and Jose Araminta were Cicero Schent the Orator was a Pima. The Pimas and ^Papagos^ speak the same language  with Kind regards to yourself and brethren I remain your brother in the Gospel of Christ.  Milton S Ray  302 West 3rd South St. S. L.

Tenney, I worte to him, and I received no answer for a long time, and I was afraid the letter was stopped at Sr Johns, but I finally received a letter from him saying that he had received my letter and  immediately wrote to me. But I never received  his letter until his second letter of March 5th. I thought it wisdom to forward to you letter, as  you will see his poverty, also the names he has sent for approval. The men he has named are Spanish Scholars, and I think would be able missionaries among the Lamanites, if they meet your approval.  It appears to me that the time has come when we ought to turn the attention of our missionary labor more to the House of Joseph than we have done, as you say "the Gentiles are fast rejecting the Gospel" and as they are rejecting it, the Spirit of God seems to be moving more upon the Lamanites to re- ceive it.  Brother Milton S. Ray is now in ENDENTRY wife there, she is quite sick. I have asked him to give me a des- cription of the location of those Southern Tribes, which he has done. And, thinking it better than to make an extract I send  you his letter that you may get an understanding of the situtation and location of these tribes. From what I learn about Bro Ray, not named in his letter, he is in straitened circumstances, and wants to get some emplotment; will teach Spanish, or do anything else to help himself. Could there not be some assistance obtained for Brother Tenney and Ray from the "Bishop's Store- houses."?  I had a very interesting interview in St. George with both Elders John H. Smith while on their visit here. I have been in the  enjoyment of good health, with the exception of a  cold for a few days' past.
