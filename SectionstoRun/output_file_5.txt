L.  April 6 1893.  ENDENTRY Provo City, Sept. 30th 1891  President Wilford Woodruff. Chairman General Board of Education.  Dear Brother,  In compliance with my instructions I herewith submit respectfully the Annual Report of the operation of our church- schools during the academic year 1890â€”1891.  As was to be expected, the establishment of the Freeschool System has not been without material influence upon our churchschools, so that the four Seminaries at Springville; 14th Ward, and Fremont had to be discontinued by decision of their respective Boards, and the Stake Academies at Snow- flake, and St. Joseph do not intend to open the ensuing school year for lack of funds.  The Seminary at Samaria has been combined with the Stake Academy at Malad, and the Principal of the former, Bro. Samuel Davis, has joined the Stake Academy as one of the regular teachers.  Much difficulty has been experienced by many of the Boards of Education paying no attention to the instructions given by the General Board of Education in the General Cir- culars, and in the "Church School Papers"' as published in the Juvenile Instructor.  The reason for this is not so much an intentional opposition as ^rather^ a careless indifference on  ENDENTRY the part of members of such Boards, which causes them to take very little, or in some instances, no concern at all ab- out the duties of their membership.  In consequance of this all the work devolves upon one or two, who occasionally, feel reluctant in assuming all the responsibility. A reconstruction of many of these Boards, that carry such "deadhead's" becomes a matter of necessity, but can only be affected in a satisfactory manner, by the First Presidency taking this matter in hand.  As an illustration of the foregoing complaint is the manner in which the request of the General Superinten- dent was responded to in regard to the supply of teachers for the coming school year.  The "Church School Papers" No. 5, Juv. Instro May 1st, requested all Boards needing teach- ers for the coming school year to report to the General Superintendent during June, so that appropriate selections could be made.  The urgency of the case consisted in the increased demand for district school teachers and the greater financial advantages offered by School-Trustees. The y indecision of many of our Boards discouraged several teachers, and I could not find it in my heart to keep them in suspense until all good positions in district schools were filled, and these teachers after all waiting perhaps yet disappointed in ob- taining the coveted position in the church school. In this way the Church School Service has lost several efficient teachers, where places had to be supplied afterwards by less experienced ones.  ENDENTRY 2. continued.  Several Boards of Education did not make final arrange- ments for Principals and Teachers until the latter part of the present month.  Such a course will frustrate every attempt for reaching the high aims of our educational system.  While fully realizing the financial embarrassment under which the most of our Boards of Education are laboring, the undesigns is convinced by his own educational experience, that the cause of our church schools could be advanced far beyond its present status by united and intelligent efforts of the various Boards of Education, in keeping close ellbow-feeling with the General Boards.  The importance of the engagement of a lady-teacher or a Matron for the special instruction of the female pupils, of the cultivation of Singing ^and the^ attendance of some one of ^from^ every church school at the Annual and at the Drespective Dis- trict and Branch Conventions is not yet appreciated thoroughly, nor are many members of the various Boards very anxious to keep themselves posted in regard to the instructions given from time to time by the General Board.  In thus frankly stating the chief drawbacks that until now have encumbered our progress I have not done so in  ENDENTRY a spirit of faultfinding with my co-laborers, but with a desire to point out such deficiencies in our operations as need our first attention.  In these critical times, when our public school system is supplied with all the  most improved appurtenances of moden education and can secure the services of the best teachers by good salaries, our Church School Organization would upon wear itself out in the futile attempt to keep ahead of all these enticements, if not every member of these Boards and Faculties will perform his duty in the spirit of a sacred mission.  Accompanying this letter is my annual report, both statistical and financial, but I regret exceedingly the in- completeness of the same, which has been caused by the failure of some of the Boards to respond to my re- peated and urgent requests to send in their reports. In some instances I received only semi-annually reports, in others the receipts and disbursements were not specified as to Cash, Mdw, or Produce, and in others again these specifications were so terribly mixed that it was very difficult to unraval them, not withstanding the plainness of the blanks.  As General Circular No. 7. pages 3 and 4, par. 1. requires only an Annual Report to be made out henceforth, to be sent in on or before every July 15th, the confusion in the minds of some Board-Secretaries and Treasurers will be avoided, and I shall have time sufficient to get things into proper shape for my October-Conference-Report.  ENDENTRY 3. continued.  The experience of the first two years of our operations has suggested a few changes in the blanks for our statistical report which I shall respectfully submit to you for your approval before long.  No financial reports have been received for the last academic year from Weber Stake Academy; Nephi; Snowflake Stake Academy, Arizona ^and Springville Seminary^.  After my reports were closed and cop- ied last night, I received reports from St. George S. Academy, and Huntington Seminary, a summary of which I enclose as a supplementary.

WILFORD WOODRUFF, PRESIDENT, KARL G. MAESER, D, L. D. GEN. SUPERINTENDENT, GEO. REYNOLDS, SECRETARY. Provo, December 17th 1891 President Wilford Woodruff. Dear Brother,  In conformity with the program of travel submitted to  you in my letter of the 11th ult., I left Provo, Wednesday, November 18 with D. and R G. Ry, at 11.40. Am, Bro. Wm. C. Spence having kindly provided me with halffare passes  as far as Holbrook, and with a letter from the Supt. of the Southern Pacific to insure me halffare rates for my  return trip via California. I arrived at Holbrook, Saturday, Nov. 21, at 1 P.M. and was received at the station by Pres. Jesse N. Smith and some other bretheren.  An appointment  had been made for me to address that evening the people at Woodruff which I did on the leading subjects Churchschools, Religion Classes, Sundayschools, and M. I. Associations, and  the much needed assistance and cooperation of the Fireside. As these have been the mainsubjects ^of^ all my public  addresses during my four weeks labors in Arizona, I do  not need to refer to them here again when speaking  of the other places.  I addressed during that period 13 public  meetings, visited 4 churchschools, 3 districtschools, 1 Sundayschools,  2 Primaries, in all of whom I had to give some remarks  to the children, held 3 meetings with educational boards, ENDENTRY and 3 consultations with Faculties, allen conducted 1 ex= amination of a church school teacher for the Intermediate  Grade, and conducted several class exercises by special  request of the teachers, to illustrate some methods in teaching. In every place in I have visited I have found  former students of the B. Y. Academy, who as a rule were  pronounced by their presiding Priesthood active workers  in the cause of the Latterday Work.  Snowflake. Bro. Logan to  Snowflake, to take charge of that Stake Academy, has with.,  drawn from the educational field, and is now Bishop  at Woodruff. Although Bro. Savage is a man of sterling worth and a faithful Latterday Saint, he does not seem to  have succeeded in obtaining the affection of the students and  the confidence of a portion of the community in his ability. The Academy has suffered much in consequence.  President  Hunt in connection with  some line members of the Stake Board obtained, late in  the season the services of Bro. Webb, a farmer and well  experienced teacher.  Bro. Webb has been very reluctant to  accept the position but consented merely to help the  Board out of the difficulty until a permanent teacher  could be obtained.  Bro Webb has a large family and  thinks he must do something more remunerative.  He  wants to go into the Rachbusiness, for which in the  opinion of Pres. J. N. Smith he is not at all qualified. I found Bro. Webb, assisted by his wife, doing good work  in the Academy.  They had then 56 students of the V. W.

Webb promised me to recon= sider his intention of quitting teaching, if the prospects should  brighten up a little more financially.  This Academy has not yet  received its appropriation fot this year, as the Board had failed to report to Secretary Reynolds, that their Academy was in running order.  At the meeting of the Stake Board  the necessity of reorganizing the Board became apparent, and some more active members were intended to be added  at their next Quarterly Conference.  According to the testimony  of Pres. JN. Smith and his bretheren, there is not in whole Snowflake a single young man or boy to be found, that  drinks, smokes, or takes the name of the Deity in vain. This is then the only place in Zion of this kind, that  I have found.  Visited also by special request of the  Trustees the disctrictschools at Snowflake and at Taylor,  giving the teachers a few points, and addressing the  pupils, suitable to the occasion.  It is a remarkable fact  that the Territorial Commissioner of Education, in a  lengthy letter to Pres. JN. Smith declares Prayer to be  illegal  in a districtschool, hence no prayers can be offered  up in these schools.  They are otherwise well provided with ENDENTRY will all the appliances of improved education, alongside  of which facilities our poor churchschools make but a  sorry show.  St. Johns. Arrived here on Thanksgiving Day, and addressed a special  meeting of the Students that same evening.  The Academy is  located in the Tithing office, occupying three rooms, two of  which are fitted up already with new desks, etc. etc. and the  third room will be furnished during the holidays.  Bro.  John W. Brown is the Principal, having conducted thus  far the Academy without an Assistant.  Bro. Brown, a Graduate of the University of Deseret, is a worthy man  and able teacher, he passed his examination for the  Intermediate Grade before me during my stay at St. Johns.  Pres. Udall promised me in behalf of the  Board to give Bro. Udall ^JW. Brown ^ a lady as Assistant after  the holidays.  We could get no boardmeeting of the  members, and Pres. Udall will endeavor to reorganize  the Stake Board at their next Quarterly Conference, so  that the work may be attended to in future more  satisfactorily than in the past.  In this connection,  I desire to report, that I am advising every Board  to appoint a "Visiting Committee" of Two from out of  their number, whose duty it shall be to visit their  churchschool at least once every ten weeks for one  whole day, and make a written reporot of their visit  to their respective Board, and that the full Board  should meet at least once a Term; members that  ENDENTRY OFFICE OF THE  GENERAL BOARD OF EDUCATION  OF THE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.

The increasing interest in our  educational system manifested by the people of St. Johns  by their attendance at each of the succeeding meetings en= courages Stake  Academy and its appendages, the Religion Classes.  As in  Snowflake so in St. Johns, we organized a Monthly  Churchschool Convention, at which the most of the Dis= trictschool Teachers, Religion class Instructors, etc. etc. etc. are intending to take part.  The Saints here have many  evil influences to content with on account of the close  proximity of the Mexican element, whose degraded  moral and intellectual condition baffles almost belief. The Principal of the District school, being one of my former  pupils, rquested me to visit his school also.  There  had been some friction between the interests of  the Districtschool and of the Academy in the past, but, I trust, that my labors in that direction have  not been in vain, and all antagonism will be  replaced by mutual cooperation for the good of  the rising generation. ENDENTRY St. Joseph Stake. Arrived at I was kindly re= ceived at the family of Pres. Academy  during the following day.  Bro. Geo. Cluff, former Normal Student of the B. Y. Academy, Principal, with Bro. Charles  Borden, as Assistant.  The Academy has been late in star= ting this season, on account of not getting a Principal until the arrival of Bro. Geo. Cluff.  Bro. Cluff had only  come to pay a flying visit to his relatives previous to his  going East, to pursue studies in the elocutional line. His financial calculations, however, suddenly failed  and he was prevailed upon to accept the position  at the Stake Academy.  Bro. Cluff far surpassed my  expectations in regard to his efficiency, and promises  to make his mark soon in that part of the count= ry.  The Academy is now finally located in the new Tithing office building at Thatcher, occupying thus far  the upper room.  There are two smaller rooms down= stairs, which the Board will put into proper shape  during the holidays for classpurposes, in as much  as the reciting of two departments in the one  room upstairs is of great inconvenience to both  teachers and students.  Programs and Plans, and  their execution are exceedingly creditable to Bro. Cluff, who is instructing also his young Assistant as much as possible, preparatory to the latter's taking  a Normal Course in the B.Y. Academy next schoolyear.

IV. and III Readgrades, but comparitavely very far behind  in their studies for want of opportunities to have  an education.  The Records of the churchschools in  Arizona have been kept in a rather lose manner thus  far, but as I took some pains with each of those Prin= cipals in regard to this point, we may expect in future  exact reports concerning their work.  An appointment  had been made for me, Saturday, Dec. 5, to attend the  Quarterly Primary Conference at Central Ward, halfways between Pima. That meeting gave me an  opportunity to explain to the officers of that organization  to true spirit of cooperation with the Religion - Classes, as there had been here as elsewhere a friction had sprung  up contrary to the Sirit of the Gospel and our mutual aims.  Sunday fore and afternoon meetings for all the  Saints in the Stake had been announced at Pima. Therefor the first time during my ministry for the  last twenty years my voice broke down in the afternoon  for a little while.  Two heavy sandstorms which I had  passed through during the last few days had made  my throat sore, but a few spoons of consecrated oil ENDENTRY cleared it all up.  In the evening two Pima brotheren called on me and presented to me their grievances  in regard to the removal of the Thatcher, claiming that Pima was the place for it.  There has  been quite a contention on the subject, running even  among the Stake Board.  I did not like the spirit  of these two bretheren at first, but in a three hours' conversation the temperature of their feelings changed  entirely, and they became reconciled, if not fully  convinced to the condition of affairs  Pima Seminary. The following day Monday, I attended the Pima Seminary  the whole day.  The Seminary holds its sessions in the  Stake Meetinghouse, and is comfortably enough situ= ated as far as the locality goes; they have also a num= ber of fair tables for 60 students, but no apparatus of  any kind, save one blackboards, and thus far no records at all.  The people are sustaining the school well, over 50 in attendance, and better advanced  as a general thing than the students of the  Stake Academy at Thatcher.  Bro. Geo. Macdonald a former pupil of mine, is Principal.  His Assistant, a lady, had got out of my way under some pre= tence or another.  This is the first instance of this  kind, that a teacher has done such a thing.  I expressed  my indignation to the Local Board at such a course, and they decided to release her and engage another  in her place.  The latter was introduced to me, to give  ENDENTRY OFFICE OF THE  GENERAL BOARD OF EDUCATION  OF THE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS. WILFORD WOODRUFF, PRESIDENT, KARL G. MAESER, D. L.

All the  Arizona Churchschool Teachers are either licensed al= ready or will become so before New Year.  I had a very  interesting meeting with the Local Board in the af= ternoon, which was also attended by the Stake Presidency,  and a majority of the members of the Stake Board. Whatever differences may have existed between the two  bodies, they were all satisfactorily adjusted on that  occasion, so that both Boards and Schools can work  henceforth harmoniously in their respective spheres. Tuesday forenoon I made my final visit to the Stake  Academy at Thatcher, addressing the last half hour  the students, as I was in the habit of doing at every  churchschool before leaving.  There was a large meeting  appointed for the afternoon in the meetinghouse, for  parents and students.  The Trustees of the Districtschools, at Central, and Thatcher, had closed their  schools that afternoon to give their teachers the opportunity  to attend that meeting.  The house was terribly crowded. The Churchschool Convention of St. Joseph Stake was or= ganized.  Although I have always opposed our  ENDENTRY our churchschool-teachers taking part in dramatic per= formances, I have concluded that Bro. Geo. Cluff may  finish his contract with the Dramatic Association  of Thatcher, which he had made before he had entered  the Churchschool Services.  He has only three more  performances to give.  I have succeeded to cure  Bro. Cluff of his dramatic and elecutionary craze, so that he will settle down now for a more steady  course in life.  There is a glorious opportunity for  him to do a great work there.  Deming. By advice of Pres. Tucson, on my way to  Division Supt. of the Southern Pacific to secure halffare rates to California.  I presented  a letter from Supt. Horsburgh of San Franciso, promising  me halffare rates.  That Division Supt. at Tucson treated me  very uncourteous and refused to do anything, ignoring  the letter of his superior.  I have seen in the papers since, that a Strike of the employees along the line was to take  place that same evening, which may account for his  ill humor.  I felt mad, took the train for Deming, just  coming in, and wrote a letter of apology to Pres. Hobson  from Deming.  At the latter place I held a long conver= sation with Bishop Johnson, just returned from Mexico. The Diaz Academy is progressing finely, and the two  teachers will soon apply for Licences.

President Wilford Woodruff Dear Brother,  At an official visit I paid yesterday to the Brigham  Young Academy, taking notes, attending the recitations of  the teachers, and meeting with the Faculty after school in special session, of which proceedings I shall make  due report to you in connection with my report of my  southern circuit commencing with today - I found  that all the teachers of the Brigham Young Academy,  teaching academic studies, are using officially the title  "Professor" on the bulletin-boards and elsewhere in  the Academy.  As this is against the rule adopted by  the General Board of Education, laid down in General  Circular No. 7, page 5, I objected to this at the Faculty - meeting.  None of these teachers, except Professor Cluff, who has his Diploma, holds even a License for these  academic studies.  Several of them have handed to me  last night their applications for Licenses in their re= spective academic studies, endorsed by Brof. Cluff as  Principal.  I have filled out blanks accordingly and  submit them herewith respectfully for your con= sideration.  These teachers solicit the permission of  ENDENTRY the General Board to use the title "Professor" on the  strength of these Licenses, as they are ready to pass their examination for the "Academic Degree" next  spring.  According to your instructions to submit my  opinion on all pending questions in Church School matters, I venture to state, that this question does not  concern the teachers of the Brigham Young Academy  alone, but can be applied to the Colleges at Salt  Lake and Logan as well.  The granting of the  request of the B. Y. A. teachers would necessitate, therefore, some modification of the paragraph  in the Gen. Circ. No. 7, above alluded to.  I shall return from Provo, Friday,  Jan 29th, when I should be pleased to receive  any instruction from you on this point, or  can call on you any day between January 30 and  February 4th.

Dear Brother,  In conformity with the arranged program for the Fifth  Circuit, of which notice had been given to the respective Stake  President and Principals, I arrived at Logan, Tuesday, April 19th  and was cordially received and hospitably entertained by  Prof. B. Y. College. Wednesday,  was spent exclusively in attending the class exercises at the  B. Y. College. It is with much satisfaction that I can report the  fine condition of this College in regard to intellectual pro- gress, as well as to spiritual standing and general discipline;  although it must be stated that it has been somewhat  hard at first for Prof. Paul to partake of the spirit of our  educational system; in as much as ^during^ the first few months  of his labors at the College his usefulness was greatly im- paired by his vigorous participation in the struggles of  the political arena and his theological instructions being  based too much upon the vain philosophies of the age,  both of which mistakes Bro. Paul is mainly striving to  overcome. It is to be regretted that by the time this efficient  teacher, promisesing to become such a valuable co-laborer  of ours, will g will leave the educational profession and ENDENTRY devote his fine talents to law and politics in which pursuits  he expects to find more adequate remuneration. The College  is sustaining a serious loss by the resignation of Bro. Kerr,  who has accepted a call as Professor of Mathematics at the  Gowans  from the Paul is ably sustained  by his faculty, among whom Bros. Apperly de- serve especial mention as the chief standard bearers of the  spirit of the Latterday Work in the College. A very pleasing  feature of the B. Y. College is the Preparatory Dept. in charge  of Sister Hoving, an experienced Lady and Primary Teacher,  and fervent Latterday Saint. Like many other young talented, but ambitious teachers, Prof. Paul was inclined  to build up higher classes for scientific and litterary  pursuits to the neglect of the fundamental branches  of education. The objection to such a course does not lie  merely in the fact that only comparatively few are prepared  to take such courses and the expenses of maintaining them  would amount to in some instances from $150 to $200  for each student per annum, but that such studies  require the most efficient teachers of the faculty, who  have to devote their whole time to the instruction of  perhaps 10 to 12 students in all, while their labors are  taken away from about 200, who are just as much  entitled to the benefits of their instructions. In follow- ing up this original inclinations Prof. Paul intended  even to dismiss Mrs. Hoving with her whole Department  of from 60 to 75 children in order to make room for ENDENTRY WILFORD WOODRUFF, PRESIDENT.

In my representation of the case to the College Board of Trustees,  Prof. Paul was told that the Trustees would find the rooms  for Sister Hoving and her pupils, us ^for as^ many as she could get.  As Prof. Paul has practically demonstrated his earnest desire to  fall into line with our educational system as fast as he can,  It would be unfair to criticize too closely the deficiencies in  the Records to be kept in every one of our church schools ac- cording to Gen. Circ. No. 7, page 17, the more so as his pre- decessor, Prof. Tanner has not left them in as complete a  condition as they should be. I have Bro. Paulâ€™s promise  to have them in order by next academic year. Thursday,  April 20, I met with the Trustees of the College, to which meeting  by was attended by my request, by President Orson Smith  and his counsellors. The organization of the a Stake Board  of Education was discussed and affected. The interview was  an exceedingly pleasant one and will probably be produc- tive of much good in the educational interests of that  Stake. I had the pleasure of addressing that same evening  a crowded meeting of students and patrons of the B. Y. College  on the aims and spirit of our educational system.  By special invitation of Apostle Moses Thatcher I par- ENDENTRY ticipated in the exercises of the Conferences of the Relief So- ciety and Y. L. M. I.

Miss Esther Parkinson having been duly licensed as teacher  for the Primary Grade at the beginning of the present  academic year, and appointed to conduct a Primary  School at Franklin, in lieu of a Seminary, and I, not  receiving any report from there for a long time, made  inquiries concerning the school.  To my surprise I  was informed that the school had discontinued,  and the new Seminary building being rent to the  District School Trustees. I wrote an explanatory letter  to President Parkinson in regard to the mode of  procedure in such cases and obtained the promise  of proper observance of our regulations for the future.

After having participated in the meetings of the Oneida  Stake Conference at Franklin during Sunday and  Monday, April 23 and 24, where opportunities had been  given me to urge upon the people the necessity of  true education, I left in company with Pres.

The meeting was crowded to  overflowing and addressed by Pres. J. F. Smith, Apostles Thatcher and Lyman, and myself.  The Stake Academy  had just closed its session the previous Friday.

Hoskins, with whom I  attended the following day a meeting of the Stake Board  at Malad and in the evening a public meeting at  Samaria in the educational interest. The farmer Sem- inary at Samaria has been discontinued for the present  academic year, and its Principal, joined the Stake  Academy at Malad as Assistant Teacher, by mutual ENDENTRY agreement between the Stake and the local Board. Thursday,  April 28 I spent the whole day in attending the exercises at  the Stake Academy, conducted by the Principal alone. The  School having diminished very much to a great extent,  the Assistant Teacher has taken to his farmwork during  the last term, leaving the Principal alone to conduct all  the classes of the 3. 4. and 5. Readergrades. Bro. Geo. Cole is a  faithful worker and is improving professionally in  a very satisfactory manner. This school is on a solid  foundation. The Board contemplates to enlarge the accommodations for the school by preparing a  portion of their yet unfinished tabernacle next sum- mer.  These improvements can be made at a com- paratively small expense. There is yet a very large amount of local jealousy between Ma- lad as to the permanent location of the Stake Acad- emy, which is greatly to the disadvantage of the  institution. The sooner the General Board would  give instructions to have this question definitely  settled the better it would be for the educational interest of that Stake. Public meetings at Malad and Portage in the evenings of Wednesday ^Tuesday^ and Thursday,  April 26 and 28th, h in the interest of our church school  movement, have not been, I trust, without some beneficial results.

The great Fast meeting the next day was spent with  the rest of the Saints in a four hours meeting under the in- fluence of the Spirit of God in a very marked degree, when I  also found time to perform the duties of my mission.  A very pleasant meeting of the Stake Board was held in  the afternoon and evening, after which an adjournment  was taken to attend a public meeting especially arranged for  me. The subject of Religion â€“ Classes formed the chief topic  of my remarks. Monday, May 2d was spent in the Academy.   Here the Principal Bro. A. F. O. Nielsen conducted the Primary  Dept. inclusive of III and IV Readers alone; the larger students,  constituting the Intermediate Grade, having had to quit  for the IV term on account of farm work. Outside of  the B. Y. College I have seen no- where among our church schools such splendid primary  work as there is being done by Bro. Nielsen. Although  the new Academy building is not quite finished, it is  sufficiently so that both stories can be used by the Ac- ademy to advantage. that small Stake, thinly popu- lated, composed mostly of new settlers struggling with  the arid soil for a living, calls for my admiration  for their faith and united energy to make their Academy ENDENTRY a success. Unfortunately Bro. Nielsen is determined to leave  in spite of the pleadings of the people. He desires to pur- sue his studies for qualifying himself in higher  grades.  I shall be crowded for Principals next year, as  several others have given notice to quit for the same  reason, and the sufficient supply of qualified  persons for such positions becomes exceedingly  doubtful.  Bannock Stake Academy.  Tuesday, May 3d found me again on the road in order  to reach Market Lake, arriving at my destination Wednesday afternoon,  May 4th. President Ricks having met me at Market Lake,  and made me comfortable at his house at Rexburg.  Thursday, May 5th, I spent in visiting the Stake Academy, con- ducted by Bro. Chas. N. Watkins, as Principal, and Sister  Barnes, Assistant. The school has registered for this  IV Term about 75 students, all the way from the Chastoless  to the V Reader grade, although of the latter are only a  few left, the rest had to quit on account of farming.  Bro. Watkins has infused new life into the educa- tional affairs, and is ably assisted by Sister Barnes.  The great drawback for the further development of  this Stake Academy is the absolute refusal of all  the Wards of at the southside of the river to support  the Academy in anyway, either by sending students,  or with means. This feeling extends to the public meetings  and to Quarterly Conferences. When holding meetings  by appointment at Eagle Rock, which ENDENTRY WILFORD WOODRUFF, PRESIDENT. KARL G. MAESER, D. L.

The Bishops declare that it is the  unanimous feeling of the Saints on the south side of the  river, that they are suffering for want of spiritual nourish- ment on account of the geographical location of their  section of the Stake, and that there be no hope for them until  they get organized into a Stake for themselves. Although  this feature does not belong to my department for discussion,  I have to refer to it as it greatly impedes the progress of  the educational work.  The Watkins  having not been very exact and keeping the records re- quired in our schools, Bro. Watkins has great difficultly  in straightening up his books, but hopes to have them  all in order before opening of the next school season.  For the reason of above alluded to a quorum of the Stake Board  could not be obtained and some informal conversation bet- ween a few members present and myself had  in the edu- cational interest had to take its place. Several meetings  with the teachers during Friday and Saturday resulted  in arriving at a mutual understanding in regard to aims, ENDENTRY methods and other details in our professional career.  During Sunday, I attended Sunday School in the forenoon,  and public meeting in the afternoon, at both of which  occasions I labored in the interest of the rising genera- tion.  Bear Lake Stake.  L. D. S. Seminary at Montpelier.  After having filled my appointments made for me by  Pres. Eagle Rock, I left  the latter place Tuesday, May 10th, with the midnight  train and reached Montpelier in the afternoon, Wed- nesday May 11th. The Seminary here has been in charge  of Bro.  Mary, both of  whom are faithful young people, but not yet being  Graduates, their efficiency is rather limited in some  respects. It was the best, however, that could be  done under the circumstances. They had to run  the Seminary at their own financial risk, but filled  the house with about 75 pupils this winter. Bp.  Rick and his Associates have succeeded finally  to obtain full possession of the grounds and  building and contemplateing to conduct the school  the coming academic year in proper shape. We had  a very pleasant meeting of the Local Board that same  evening. The Seminary had closed, and I found  some of the Records in satisfactory condition, and for  the balance missing instrucked Bro. Winters, how to keep  them, which he promised me to do.

Dear Brother,  Having finished the third this year's education educational circuit  in accordance with previously arranged and approved program, I herewith submit respectfully the observations made of the various visits.  Latter day Saints' College.  This institiution was visited by me Friday, March 10,  during the whole day, during which I attended the days recitations according to the Daily Program, examined the records, and met with the Principal and Teachers in  Faculty. Everything was found in excellent condition, and showing very satisfactory progress in all branches. Plan and Program are justiciously arranged, the discipline is exemplary and calculated to carry its influence to  the homes of the sudents. The Principal, Prof. Willford Dove, enjoys the fullest confidence and support of his Stakes and Local Boards. The College shows a larger attendance than ever before. By arrangement of the Stake Presidency,  a normal class for the officers of the Y. L. M. J. A. of the Stake has been conducted by Bro. Dove and attended by about fifty ladies, who honored their instructions with a tangible ENDENTRY testimonial of their appreciation of his labors in their behalf. It was my privilege to address that class of ladies, and also in succession a "Young Men's Theological" class, and the stu- dents of the whole school. By special request, I closed my visit to this excellent institution with a lecture to the "Student's Society" the same evening. The classrooms of  the College are in many respects inadequate for the great work to be performed there, although too much praise cannot be bestowed upon the Board of the College for the energy and devotion displayed by them, to look after the interests and necessities of the institution.  Central Ceminary  In conformity with appointments made for me by President Murry, Friday, March 24th to vis- it the Central Seminary at Horace Cummings,  the Principal, is assisted by Bro. Samuel Cornwall, and both have conducted during this acedemic year about 102 stu- dents, although this number has been greatly reduced of  late on account of the advanced season calling the  young men to the labors on the farms. The Plans and Programs of former years and terms were not formed to be all recorded, but I obtained the promise from  the Principal that this part of the Records should also  be complete before June 30. All other Records were  satisfactory. The labors of these two teachers are blessed with very pleasing results in regard to intellectual progress as ENDENTRY Apr 12 1893  Letterhead  WILFORD WOODRUFF, PRESIDENT, KARL G. MAESER, D. L.

After ad= dressing the students at the closing exercises in the afternoon, I met with the Local Board, Bp. Rawlins, chairman.  It is astonishing what the six Wards, represented by this Board, have accomplished thus far by their united efforts in behalf of their Seminary, although they are laboring still under the burden of financial embarrassment like the most of our Church Schools at present.  Eighteenth Ward Seminary  As per appointment, I attended this institution, Monday, March 27, and found the Principal, Bro. Gideon M. Mumford, assisted by Mrs. Is= abelle Solomon, superintending a school of about 200 pupils, distributed ina Primary, Preparatory, mid-Intermediate Department.  The accommodations in regard to rooms,  unclear ises, light, ventilation, warmng, furniture, not affections are of the first order, with the exception of lights in the Primary department.  I have obtained the promise from the Board that my suggestion for improvement in this regard shall be attended to.  Principal and Teachers in this Seminary are faithful and intelligent workers, although in some of their methods not quite up to the requirements ENDENTRY of our advanced educational systems.  The suggestions in this regard made to them will, no doubt, receive careful attention in future, so that the attainment of desireable results may be facilitated.  The students are very much attached to their teachers and the exercises which I witnessed and the specimens of work done, placed before me, showed a commendable degree of pro= gress at an average.  The Records were in a satis= factory condition.  The same evening I had the privilege of meeting with the Board of Education of Salt Lake Stake.  That interniand was exceedingly pleasant and I trust, pro= fitable to the educational interests of the Stake.  Weber stake Board of Education, and Academy.  In conformity with appointments made for me by Pres. L. W. Shurtliff, I delivered a lecture to the Polysophical Society of the Weber Stake Academy, at Ogden, Saturday, March 11, and the following day, Sunday, addressed a Sunday school in the forenoon, public meeting in the afternoon, and a Ward meeting in the evening. The Weber Stake Academy I attended, on Monday, March 13. the Principal Bro. Emil Isgreen, is assisted by Bro. Wm. H. Jones for the Academic Dept. Bro. Albert N.

Bro. Jones will probably finish ^complete^ this spring his examination for the academic degree in Modern Languages, as he with the Principal has already conducted under an AnnualLicense academic branches the present schoolyear.  The Board of Education of Weber Stake is wide awake, and seems to be determined that none of the many educational instatutions in Ogden shall outstrip them in efficiency. In consequence of the very unsatisfactory condition in which the Records of the institution were handed over to Bro. Isgreen by his me not yet complete, but I have the assurance from the Principal that they shall be straight before the end of the academic year. The large attendance of visitors at my address to the stu= dents in the afternoon testified to the great interest which the people of Ogden show ^take^ in their Stake Academy. The register shows 100 inrolled students for the present academic year.

Box Elder Stake Academy.  In responce to an appointment made for me by President Rudger Clawson, I addressed the a large audience in the Third Ward, the same evening, and visited the Stake Academy during the whole of the fallowing day, Wed= nesday, March 15.  The Principal,Bro. Augns Vance, is assisted by Bro. Geo. W. Watkins, and both teachers are faithful and conscientious workers, who should be approciated for more than it seems to be the case. The attendance is below the number everyone could reasonally expect in a community like Brigham City.  The cause of this deficiency cannot be found in the teachers work at the Academy for that is very satisfactary, and appears to be fully appreciated by the students, some of whom are quite advanced young ladies and gentlemen.  I have laid, however, more stress upon the necessity of the Principal visiting the students and leading citzens professionally, in the case of Bro. Vance, than anywhere else, in order to culsionte  and influence in favor of the Academy, small of oru educational aims in general...All the Records of labors in Box  Elder Stake concluded with a meeting with the Faculty, and with one with the Stake Board, after school and another public meeting in the evening.

Friday, March 17, I attended the Academy Bro. Geo. J. Ramsey, the Principal, has been along time whole schoolyear, as the number of students, abut 30 in all, would not justify the Board in engaging n Assis= tant.  There has been something fondamentally wrong in the managment of this Academy, financially speaking from the beginning.  In order to advance the interests of the institution as much as it was in my power, I suc= ceeded in promising a Principal for it, that not only prosseced in fficient intellectual and professional ca= pacity, but had also considerable grit and enterprise about him, so that he might be able to wrestle with the wellknown business infirmities of the Board But if it had not been for the personal assistance of of Bro. Chas. Welsh, a member  of the Board, that young man could not have maintained himself with his family.  There were only 14 student left when I visited the Academy, althouh I found the work of Bro. Ramsey ENDENTRY worthy of a larger scope of usefulness.  We hoped to make his engagement at Morgan a permanent one, and to that end he has commenced to build himself a home, mostly with his own hands, assisted some by his brother; but it seems that few have taken any notice of his efforts, except fine talk.  His Records are kept in fine style.  At the Boardmeeting, the mem= bers expressed themselves willing to start afresh and under all possible assistance to the Principal. I told them that otherwise I should have to find a more suitable place for Bro. Ramsey, but could not  conscientinus recommend someone else to take his place at Morgan.  They furnished me, however, a large and very attentive audience in the evening.  Summit  Stake  Academy  Saturday, March 18, I arrived at Coalville, according to provious appointment, spending the evening in con= sultation with President Frank Olson, and come members of the Board on Academy affairs.  They intended to dismiss the Primary Teacher, Miss Helen Winters, for fear there would not be pupils enough to commence another term with.  Knowing ENDENTRY Miss Winters to be an excellent Primary Teacher, I did not think that the fear of the Board was well grounded, and begged of them not to make a final decision until I should have had a chance to speak to the people, which was readily agreed to.  The following day, Sunday, was spent in addressing a Sun- day school in the forenoon, a public meeting in the after- noon, and a Conjoined Meeting of the M.J. Associations  in the evening. Monday, March 20, I found the Intermediate Department of the Academy located in a hall belonging to a  Hotel, which is used also for a theatre, and dancing almost  every night during the week. The room cannot be comfortably  warmed, and is not adapted for school purposes. The Primary  Department is in the vestry of the Tabernacle, across the yard,  and although small, holding just 32 pupils, is very comfortable and was neatly decorated by the ingenuity of Miss Winters. I attended the exercises in both departments for two hours,  and examined the records, finding everythingvery satisfac- tory. On my request, Pres. W. W. Cluff had extended a general invitation to the people to attend the Academy in the hall at H. S. M. The hall was crowded at the appointed time.  I improved the opportunity to urge upon the people the ne- cessity of sustaining their Stake Academy, and explaining ENDENTRY the aims and purposes of the First Presidency and  of the General Board of Education in regard to our  church schools. After the close of the meeting, the people commenced crowding around the Principal for the  purpose of registering their children's names for the new term commencing in the afternoon. It was formed by 1 P. M. that after the Principal had been obliged to take the III Readergrade from the Primary Dept. in to  his in order to make room there, quite a number of  children could not get admittance and had to go  home again. The last term thus will prove the best  attended for the whole school year. Miss Winters was not discharged. There was a Board meeting held in the  afternoon at which the members felt greatly elated  and felt to put forth every exertion for the development  of their Academy. They have secured the services of Bro. Olson for the next year. If the young men should continue to be as faithful, humble, and prayerful as he has started out in life, of which I have much hope  and assurance, he will be a valuable acquisition to  our corps of teachers. That same evening I started for Abraham Hoater a kind welcome had been provided for me in a private family, and left the next day, Tuesday, March 21, for  Heber City.  ENDENTRY Wasatch Stake Academy  Arrived at Heber City, the following day, Tuesday March 22th and addressed a public meeting at the Stake Tabernacle the same evening. The following day, Wednesday, March 23rd Orville Call, the Principal, is assisted by Miss Susie Ryan for the Primary Dept. There were about 130 students present, all which the two rooms could hold. The Academy is located in an old storebuilding not very convenient, but the best obtainable just now. But  the Primary Dept. upstairs is perched in a low room, poorly lighted and ventilated, so that the poor lady teacher has suffered in her eyesight and general health in consequence.  There is some fine work done by both of the teachers,  and it is a touching sight to behold so many young teachers in our church schools so earnestly devoted to this  among the youth, without appropriate  illegible and often so little encouragement. The records of the Academy are in good shape, with the exception  of the first two years in the Annual Record, which the  predecessor of Bro. Call has left incomplete, claiming that  the Board had not furnished him a book. The meeting with the Faculty and the one with the Board, were ex ENDENTRY pleasant.  The reports at the Boardmeeting showed that the Board was meeting regularly every months, and that the Wasatch Stke Board of Education was out of debt, one of the few in our Church School Organization that ^can^ claim such a distinction.  Davis Stake Academy.  In conformity with the approved program for the Huis Circuit Farmington, Wednesday, Tuesday, March 28, and addressed according to appointment by President W. A. Smith, a large audience in the Stake Tabernacle that same morning.  The next day, Wednesday, March 29, I attended the exercises at the Academy, Bro. James S. Rawlins, Principal, and Augusta Swalberg, Assistant. Both teachers are well qualified, and Miss Swalberg, having labored here before, carried considerable influ- ence among the young people.  But it seems that Bro. Rawlins, in confirming himself strictly to his Academy work exclusively, looked that sympathy with and from the people, without which the best efforts of a Prin= cipal in his classwork are wanting the life giving on sirement, and the finest products of intellectuality did in the cold climate.  The Board accepted a proposition of Bro. Rawlins to close the school at the end of the third term, as it might be deragatary o his reputation if the Academy should dwindle down under his hands.

The Board disired Miss Swalberg to continue the Preparatory Dept, but there appeared to be some private understanding between the two teachers, she also retired.  The Board is determined, however, to keep the school agoing to the end of the schoolyear too s shape.  The Records of the Academy are in excellent condition.  The same evening I filled an appointment for for me by the Stake President, to address a public meeting at the Bountiful Meetinghouse to which those Wards had been invited.  The meeting was crowded.  This closed my labors for the Third Circuit.  A General Observation in regard to Board Meetings One of the greatest drawbacks to the progress of our educa tional affairs was the indifference and irregularity of some of our Boards of Education in attending to their duties In order to rectify this evil to some extent, I suggested in the Church School Papers, No. 18, a closer observance of the rules of ENDENTRY that every Board should meet at least every three months in regular Quarterly Meetings. But finding that many Boards thus far had paid very little attention to their Church School Papers, and that the Principals felt delicate to interpose in Board matters, I have made it a rule in my meetings with the various Boards during the I, II, and III Cirtuit, and shall continue to do so  during the ponding it, to make following propositions:  1. - Every Board has to meet at least once in three months at a stated time to be arranged by themselves, as best  suitable to them. Special meetings may be called but should not interfere with the refular Quarterly ones. 2. 0 The roll call of members should be kept in the Recordbook of the Minutes on a special pages with   for the meetings. 3. - Members should be present, unless excused, and be so recorded.  4. - Those thus prevented from these ^attending^ to these duties illegible be honorably released and others put into their places. I also gave some suggestions in regard to the regular business to be transacted in the regular meetings, as  some Boards did not seem to have any conception of  anything beyond the finances.

I am therefore anxious that, in the brief limits at my disposal, it should give a fair and accurate account of Salt Lake City and the Mormon Church.  I should therefore,  esteem it a favour if you would read the enclosed notice of Salt Lake City and alter anything that you think wrong or misleading.  In addition, I should very much like if you would write a short  paragraph ( say 500 words)upon the Church of the Latter Day Saints,  seeting forth its origin, principles, and present condition.  If/you de- sire it, I should be happy to attach your name to this paragraph.  Yours very truly James F. Muirhead English Editor Baedeker's Handbooks. ENDENTRY James F. Muirhead Nov. 4/92. ENDENTRY A.

Mr. Wilford Woodruff,  Having purchased the Journal on the first of this year we now deem it an opportune time to issue to our Subscribers this circular letter stating our present position and such other things as we think advisable.  In the purchase of the paper we bought the subscription list but not the accounts.  THE LOGAN JOURNAL Co., reported to us the names of those who had prepaid into this year and have settled with us for the same.  According to the report your subscription began with us on JAN 1-1892 If this is not correct we would deem it a favor to have you notify us at once giving such information in re- gard to the date of settlement and to what date paid as will enable us to have the former publishing com- pany rectify the same.  This will not apply to anything previous to January 1st, 1892, as we have nothing  to do with anything prior to that date.  If no reply is received to this we will understand that the account is correct.  The subscription to the JOURNAL is now $3.00 per year instead of $3.50 as previously when not paid in advance.  Papers will be sent to all who were subscribers when we purchased the paper as well as those who have subscribed since until they order it stopped and make settlement therefor. That we are improving the paper need not be mentioned as it must be apparant to every reader.  We design to still further improve it and with your aid in extending its circulation we hope to do so.  At present we are making an excellent premium offer as you have probably noticed by the announce- ments we have already made and trust that you will call the attention of your neighbors and friends to the ame as you will thereby be showing them the way to get a valuable book at a figure within the reach of all. Sample copies of the paper will be sent free to any address on application.

If you simply desire, at the present time, to make an appropriation to cover the approaching Academic Year,  I think that $20.00000 will meet the ordinary expenses  for that period.

President Wilford Woodruff and Counselors,  Dear Brethren:-  I am directed by the Church Board of Education to respectfully ask from the First Presidency a special appropriate of $5,000.00 for the benefit of the Logan, to meet the difference that it is estimated will arise between its income and expenses during the present academic year.  Respectfully, Your Brother,  Geo. Reynolds,  Sec. Church Board of Edu ENDENTRY Geo Reynolds Oct 21 '95 ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Dec. 24, 1888.  President Wilford Woodruff,  City.  Dear Brother - I write with regard to matters relating to the General  Board of Education. First- With regard to the expulsion of unruly students from the Church Schools, and their admission afterwards to other Church institutions. I submit that this is a matter that most properly belongs to the department of the General Superintendent, and, therefore, that Brother Maeser be requested to write a letter on the subject, which letter will submit to you and, on receiving your approval, forward it to the principals of each of the institutions of learning under the control of the General Board.  I am in entire accord with the views expressed by Brother Maeser, that no student who has been expelled from one of our schools for misconduct should  be received into another Church school until he has made matters right with the officers of the school from which he was expelled.  I see no impropriety in the questions that Gen. supt. Maeser desires to put to the Principals of the various schools, for the information of the Board,  with regard to the Faculty, Departments, Studies, Condition, Prospects, etc, of  each school. To comply with his request will give the individual officers but little labor, and place a vast fund of information at the command of the Board,  ENDENTRY that may, and undoubtedly will, be of much value when occasions for its uses arises.  The questions presented by the Board of Weber Stake will probably  require a meeting of the General Board before they can be answered. These questions are:  "1st. In the event of the property or money being donated for the support  of the Stake Academy how will it be held- in whom will the title rest?  "2nd. Is the Stake Board of Education going to hold property under the Stake 'Ecclesiastical Corporation?'  "3rd. Is the Weber STake Board of Education intending to organize under the Laws of the Territory as an Incorporated Association?"  It seems to me, so far as the first question is concerned, that the Stake Board of Trustees is the proper body in whom the title for such property  should rest.  In regard to the second question, it appears to me that it would be  desirable, at any rate at present, not to mix our school matters and "Eccles- iastical Corporations." The schools, I imagine, will be safer from attack if  allowed to act separately.  With regard to organizing our Stake Boards under the laws of the  ENDENTRY Territory, I think the best way would be to submit the question to the General Board, as there is considerable that can be said on both sides of the question.  I believe that a meeting of the General Board would be advantageous at an early day. Not only do some of the matters above referred to require answering, but there are a few Stakes that have organized since our last meeting who desire instructions and aid. A question has also arisen whether it would not be desirable to increase the number of Church Normals. At present the Territory provides for the tuition of 40 normals at the University, while the Church only supplies 10 to the B. Y. Academy. The feeling of the former class is not kindly, as a rule, towards the Church schools and their methods, and  in view of the anticipated increase of these institutions, is seems as though it would be wise policy to provide for the necessary teachers trained in our  methods and filled with the love of the work, to fill the calls.  I have blocked out a letter for Brother Maeser, which, if you approve,  please sign.  Your Brother,  Geo. Reynolds Sec. Ch.

Dear Brother: Maricopa is the R. R. station on the Southern Pacific Ry.  nearest to Zenos, Arizona.  It would  be impossible to get a pass over that Line.  I presume they are the stiffest Company in existence in that respect.  I wrote Mr T. H. Goodman the Genl Passenger Agt. of S. P. R. R. under date of Aug.  24" stating that our General Conference would be held here ENDENTRY October 6th and that several of our people living at settlements located on his Line had written me asking me to endeavor to get them special round trip rates from Maricopa Benson and Bowie Stations, for that occasion.  In my letter to Mr Goodman I gave him to understand that if he would make satisfactory rates from the points named to Ogden and return, making tickets good for 30 days, from October 1st to Nov. 1st that I was satisfied that quite a number of our people would make up their minds to attend the Conference.  I asked Mr G. to notify me at his earliest con= venience just what he thought he could do in the premises, so that I could get word to the Presiding ENDENTRY Authorities in Arizona in good season, to get the matter before the people, so as to give those desiring to attend Conference ample time to shape their affairs to leave Oct. 1st  I tried to impress upon the gentlean the importance of  making the rates as low as he could consistently, in order to ensure,  a good representation from Stations on his Line.  I look for an ans= wer from Mr G. in a day or two,  and will then let you know what action he has taken in the premises, and if the rates are satis- factory, the brethren mentioned an attached letter could likely take advantage of the same.  The present rates from Maricopa ENDENTRY 2nd class, (the way most of our people travel) is $ 4500 for a single trip ticket. Your Brother in the Gospel W. C. Spence  P. S.  the letter from Mr. J. G.

ENDENTRY Dec 9 1889  Prest Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Brother:  In answer to the  enclosed letter from Elder L. Luhike. I will state, that a Clergy permit same  as he desires to obtain would have to be  used very carefylly, they are supposed to  be issued only to Clergymen engaged  solely as Ministers, and if at any time it  was discovered by the R. R. people that  Elder L. was using his permit travelling  back and forth attending to his own personal  duties, the permit would be taken from him.  Railway Companies whose lines run from one  State or Territory into another, do not have ENDENTRY the direction that they had in these matters  before the passage of the Inter State Com- merce Law, and a person making complaint at any time against a part holding a per- mit of the kind mentioned, to the effect  that it had been given out of order, and was  not being used legitimately, lays the R. R.  Company liable to a fine of $500000 So  that in making application for these  annual Clergy permits, we should have  assurance that they would only be used for the purposes that they are issued.  Your Brother in the Gospel W. C. Spence ENDENTRY Paris ,Idaho, June 15th. 1898  President W. Woodruff  Dear Bro.  Understanding that a certain proportion of means is laid aside for School and other educational purposes and believing that our necessities for such help, and claim, is meritorious we herewith pray you, and all others concerned in the disposal of said means to consider the object we have in view; viz. the providing for an advanced education under the influence of the Gospel for the youth of our people , and the prestage the building of such a place of learning will give us as a people whose boarders are over against the Gentiles.  We have no advanced School of any kind in this section except our Church School in the winter, which for lack of accomodation is altogether unsatisfactory, as Teachers labor under great disadvan- tages, and few Scholars can be received. Only a very few of the peo- ple is this section, or in Star Valley, or in all the region round about are able to send their children to more distant places to School, and realizing that hundreds of the Youth as naturally bright and intelligent who are poor, labor in consequence under disadvan- tages, we desire to bring the opportunities for education as near as possible to them. To erect a suitable house of such dimensions as is necessary to accomodate this section of country requires a large outlay, and although the disposition of the people is very generally favorable to it, available means is scares and we have come to a stopping place at least for the present- unless we can get some help.  The first story is up and the joists on, and we have all the material for the second story on hand. The Building is on the hill west of the town and occupies a site unsurpassed for beauty in all ENDENTRY these mountains, commanding a view almost of the entire Valley, and it will be when erected a credit to the Latter Day Saints.  We need the building, and we regret even the probability of los- ing the present season, which would have also a depressing effect.  We have considered the scarcety of money, and also the compara- tive value to the Church of other kinds of tithing in this country, and respectfully suggest that if more convenient, we do not ask for Cash or Cattle, but means of less value, at least being here, to the Church.  As you naturally would desire to know what, and how much means would, with what we still can raise ourselves, be necessary to con- tinue the work this season, we take the liberty of stating that we need two thousand dollars in produce of different kinds. We have expended upwards of $ 9000.00, and would have raised more had we not  explained to the people that our donations should not interfere with our tithing liabilities, and we believe that they took our advice as our last years tithing was increased by $2813.27 over the year before.  Hoping that our conclusion may be favorable to our much needed enterprise  We remain  Faithfully Yours  Wm Budge James H. Hart. Wm L Rich ENDENTRY Letterhead  top margin Office of W. W.

Molar I were appointed by the Stake Presidency to act as a Stake Board of Education and we had an informal meeting on the evening of the 18th, and read the letter from the General Board and discussed its contents.  As we already have one Church School (the Brigham Young College), in this stake we did not feel that it would be necessary to consider the organization of a Stake Academy but we felt that if Church Schools could be established, in the principal settlements (cities) in the Stake that many hundreds who are not qualified to enter the College could be given the benefits of religious instruction, as also many others who could not possibly afford to attend the College even though qualified ENDENTRY Letter head top left margin Office of W.

We felt that the object of establishing these schools is to offer as far as possible, opportuni- ties for the youth of Zion to receive theological instruction and that it would be our duty to extend these opportunities just as far as pos- sible, that the greatest good may be accomplished.  This is the way the Stake Presidency view this matter ^also^ as we do, taking the letter to  the Stake Presidency as a guide, but we had since been thold that it is not expected that our Board should undertake anything of that nature; that the letter to our Stake Presidency does not apply to Cache Stake as we already have a church College, and that schools of the kind we had considered, would prove detrimental to the College, and further, taht it would have been more in harmony with the intention of the General Board for the trustees of the B.Y.
