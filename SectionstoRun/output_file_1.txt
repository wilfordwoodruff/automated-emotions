G. S. L. City,  Mar. 14, 1864.  Col. Warren:  I am instructed by the Board of  Directors of the Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society  to forward you $10.00 for pure onion seed; 1 the Red and Yellow Dutch varieties. They have established Gardens at a  point so remote from other cultivation that they are able to  raise pure seeds. Last season they succeeded in raising  the Imphee seed, in purity; experiments on the stalks of which  shewed that from five gallons of juice one gallon of good  thick syrup was made on a Cook's evaporator. At the  same evaporator other cane that was worked took  7 and sometimes as high as 10 gallons to make one  of syrup.  Enclosed you have a ten dollar green back. Send your seeds immediately and oblige.  In behalf of the Society  W. Woodruff  President of D. A. and M. Society.  Rob. L. Campbell Secretary ENDENTRY L.D.S. Historian's Office,  P.O.

Dear Brethren:  Your letter of the 1st inst. in relation to the Church real estate in your Ward, and stating the necessity for its speedy organization, came duly  to hand and has been considered.  We have decided that it would be better for Brother Jesse N. Smith to join you at St. Johns, as quickly as possible, and that you employ such  legal ability as you may think best when the Court commences at your town to accomplish the end you  ENDENTRY have in view; and as you say that an organization that would be suitable for St. Johns will no doubt answer for any of your other Wards, it will be well for Brother Smith and yourself to have all your  Wards organized in the same manner as speedily as possible, adopting the plan that your legal  adviser will think best under the law. Brother Smith's own knowledge of law is doubtless considerable and with his aid and the assistance of a sound lawyer you ought to get your affairs into the best possible shape.  With kind regards, and trusting you will be very successful in securing all the Church property  for the purposes for which it was designed,  I remain  Your Brother, Wilford Woodruff  P.S.

The Stakes are widely separated and there is danger of division arising among the people, be- cause of the variety of parties there and the diverse po- litical interests which exist.  This subject has lately been considered and it has been decided that upon questions of this character it would be well to refer to one common head, so that counsel could be given to all the Presidents of Stakes in Arizona that would be harmon- ious in its effect upon the Presidency and people of   ENDENTRY each Stake.  It was felt that it would be proper for you to communicate with me upon these subjects, and in accordance with that feeling I write you this letter, a similar letter to which will be written to each of the Presidents of Stakes in Arizona.

You ask if you are permitted to use Tithing means for stake and High Council records, also to assist the Bishops to buy proper ward records for their wards, also for Tithing books for the wards and Bishop's Agents office.  These last named, books have always been charged up in the tithing; but the records for the Stake and High Council and for Bishops to use in their wards have always been furnished from local funds. In your case, however, considering ENDENTRY the straitened circumstances of your people and the diffi- culties you have had to contend with, we think it better to not enforce this rule, but to permit you to procure all these books and charge them to the tithing.

ENDENTRY President Wilford Woodruff and Counselors,  Dear Brethren:  The General Board of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association have recently had under consideration the advisability of publishing a magazine in the interest of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations, to take the place of  the late magazine called the "Contributor"; and necessarily when canvassing  the propriety of launching a new magazine on the community, the  literary affairs of the church had to be taken into account, which finally resulted in the Board deciding to make the following communica- tion to you upon the subject of Church periodicals, in the hope that some steps can be taken, if those suggested for your consideration by the  board shall be adjudged impracticable, that will result in bringing  about a better condition of affairs as to church periodical literature.  First we would call attention to the fact that the Latter-day  Saints are called upon to sustain a rather large number of periodicals,  each of which is the representative of some special interest, or the  organ of some one of other of the many institutions that stand as helps  in government in the church of Christ, such as the late "Contributor", organ of the Y. M. M. I. A., the "Younf Ladies" Journal", the organ of the  Y. L. M. I. A.; the Juvenile Instructor, organ of the Sunday Schools, the  "Woman's Exponent", organ of the Relief Societies, and the  Deseret News in its daily, semi-weekly and weekly editions as the organ  of the Church. The people are urged to sustain these several periodi- cals on the ground not only of the intrinsic value of the publications themselves, but also for the reason that it is their duty to do so be- cause of the institution of which each respectively is the organ. The ENDENTRY 2  list is a formidable one, and it cannot be wondered at if each (except- ing perhaps the Juvenile Instructor) receives only such half-hearted support as to enable it merely to drag out an existence.  In the course of an exchange of views on this subject it  appeared to the General Board of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement  Association that in the matter of church and semi-church periodicals we  were wasting a great deal of energy and accomplishing results that are  not satisfactory; that we are burdening the people too much when we urge  them to support all the periodicals enumerated above, and yet do not give them after all either the quality or quantity of literature that  should be supplied our people. We do not wish to disparage existing  periodicals, or underestimate the value of the work they are doing, but we are of the opinion that a careful consideration of the subject and a  candid judgement could reach no other conclusion.  That the Saints must have a literature distinct from the  literature of the world, and free from the innumerable errors in senti- ment, thought and fact that everywhere abounds in the literature of the world; that they must have a literature in harmony with the peculiar to the great dispensation of hte fulness of times - will be conceded by  every one; but it is doubtful if we are making that progress in the  attainment of such a literature that could be reasonably expected of us, or that is possible for us to attain to while following out present  course.  One of the main defects in our present efforts, in the  opinion of this board, is that we are attempting in a diffused way more than ought to be attempted, and certainly more than we can even  hope will succeed. Subordinate departments, mere helps in the govern- ment of the church, are in our judgment trying to do what the whole  church by united effort could alone hope to accomplish. Thus the ENDENTRY 2  Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association must have its organ, so the Young Ladies' Association, the Sunday Schools, Female Relief  Societies, and it has also been suggested that the Primaries also have  a paper. The time may come in the course of growth of the work of  the Lord, when the saints shall number millions, that such a list of periodicals can be supported and each be successful, but that is not now; and by attempting to do now what can only be successfuly done when the Saints shall number millions, and shall be strong financially,  we are doomed to meet with failure, or at least only attain partial success which often means the same thing as failure. You will observe that the whole trend of these reflections lead up to and are intended to make a plea for concentration of effort in the amtter of church and  semi-church periodicals, and an abandonment of our present diffused efforts.  One other thing we desire to call attention to is the fact that the energy displayed in the matter of publising and securing  support for periodicals is for subordinate institutions in the church,  for the helps in government rather than directly for the church itself; and the thought has occured to us that directing too much energy to what are merely auxiliary organizations within the church might in the end result in withdrawing energy that or right should be given to the  organization of all organizations - The Church of Jesus Christ. Dear as the Y. M. M. I. A., Sabbath Schools, and other auxiliary institutions are to us, still dearer is The Church, and that we would see exalted above all other institutions, as well in literary matters as in other  things, and leave all mere departments of the work to fall into their subordinate relations to the church.  These thoughts have emboldened us to suggest to our brethren ENDENTRY 4  many periodicals that are organs of auxiliary institutions in the church, and all unite in the publication and support of a grand weekly religious news and literary paper that shall be indeed the organ of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A weekly newspaper-maga- zine which shall by merit of its matter take first rank with the  great religious papers of the country and of the world. A paper which  shall in a broad way but in terse language record the principal events  of each week, among all the nations of the earth, especially in our own country, and of our own State. A paper that shall put into the  hands of our people both young and old clean literature, free from the  errors and spirit of the world. Such literature as it becomes saints  to read and have in their homes, and which, however, shall be varied and of character to broaden the mind, elevate the taste, and instruct  the understanding. A paper which while severely non-partisan in  politics, shall nevertheless in free and bold style discuss in a spirit  of true statesmanship the great political events as they arise, and affect local, national and international relations. Above all, however, a paper that shall lead religious thought, that shall keep abreast of  all religious progress; that shall disucss the character and relations  of all religions and especially that shall keep before the world the  relation of the dispensation of the fulness of times to all these. A paper that shall be pre-eminently the defender of the faith, as well  as the exponent of the doctrines of the church. A paper that shall be the voice of the church to all the world on all subjects within the  sphere of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  By the establishment of such a weekly religous newspaper- magazine we are of the opinion that without injury to any of the auxiliary institutions of the church, such as Improvement Societies,  Sabbath Schools, etc., other periodicals, organs of these several ENDENTRY 5  institutions, could be discontinued and departments assigned to them in the Church weekly paper, in which could be published their programs, outline lessons, and special instructions as occasion required from time to time. Nor need there by any fear that these departments would be over bulky or unwieldy, as an examination of the specific instruc- tions, outline lessons, etc. that appear in the respective organs of our  auxiliary organizations will disclose the fact that but little space is required for such matters, and that the bulk of the organs are taken up in the publication of a class of literature that is duplicated in  the several journals and magazines and enough of which could appear in the weekly religous newspaper-magazine proposed in these suggestions. And while these subordinate institutions would not suffer from lacking  medium through which they could be communicated with - nay, since the  general Church organ proposed would be published weekly, there would  be a positively better medium through which to impart the special  instructions suited to the current work of our auxiliary organizations  than is now afforded by their monthly and semi-monthly organs. And while this improved medium of imparting the necessary special instruc- tions to our auxiliary organization is secured - to finish the remark we started to make - The Church of Jesus Christ is exalted through its organ to its proper place. The church organ would then supply the solid  important news of the world to the saints, and make a record of the  events which mark the handiwork of God among the nations; the church would then furnish the literature that should be in the homes of the saints; the church organ free from partisan bias and party passion would then teach the wisdom of true statesmanship; the church organ -  not the organ of a subordinate organization of the church - would teach the church doctrine, announce the church policy, defend the faith, and, in a word, would be the voice of the church, through the medium of the ENDENTRY 6  press, to all the world. And while the Church through its organ is thus exalted, the helps in government naturally fall into their proper sphere  and will need to lose none of their efficiency by reason of doing so.  Next to this exaltation of the church through the plan pro- posed we may mention as an advantage the fact that the suggestions if  adoped will do away with the almost fierce competition, unavoidable  in our present circumstances, between our rival publications. The circulation of our periodicals is necessarily limited, the advertizing  patronage divided, and, therefore, the struggle for what patronage there  is both from the reading public and the advertising patrons is fierce and not conducive to the best of feelings among the publishers thus pitted against each other. This it is likely would be augmented if  we attempt to renew the publication of an organ of the Y. M. M. I. A It is proposed that Prest. Joseph F. Smith be the editor of the new  magazine, and Elder Heber J. Grant the business manager, while the list of writers promised include nearly all the brethren of prominence in literary work in the church. Such an arrangement as this brings into competition for patronage and prestige brethren among whom competition ought not to exist. That the proposed magazine so edited and so managed would be a success - that is, would get its share of the limite patron- age, both among readers and business men, cannot be doubted; but its  success would doubless be at the expense of other periodicals and the  brethren interested in them; and the greater its success the greater the injury done to competing periodicals. But abolish these organs of the several subordinate institutions, take them from the field and let such a church organ as it here suggested be established, and this fierce com- petition is done away, it becomes possible to unite all our energy upon the establishment and maintanance of one brilliant paper-magazine published in the name of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  ENDENTRY 7  Saints - to be its voice in all the world - and the saints relieved of the burden  of sustaining half of a dozen organs of subordinate organiza- tions, can be depended upon to sustain royally such a paper; while its  advertising patronage can be counted upon to be greater than the patron- age now given to all the papers and magazines combined that this pro- posed paper would displace, because of its superior standing and wider circulation.  Let no one who does not agree with the views here expresses regard the suggustions made as tending to a contraction of the literary efforts and enterprise of the church. The view of  this Board is that  it only means a concentration of effort that the proportion of results to effort may be more satisfactory, and greater good attained.  We know it will doubtless be urged that the church in this  advanced age should have a daily paper as its organ, in order to be able at any hour and every hour to repel attacks and make instant defense. Th The past conditions in the midst of which the church has lived gives weight to this view. Assailed on every hand, but especially within the limits of our own State, there has been need, perhaps, to be ready every day to repel the daily assaults. But conditions have somewhat changed, there is not the same need ot daily defense as formerly, be- cause there is not and likely will not be the daily assults, since the people of our State are no longer aligned into church and anti-church parties in politics, but are aligned on national political party lines. And no question or issue can come up within the broad sphere of the  Church which cannot with sufficient promptness be met by a weekly jour- nal. The questions that are likely to arise in a church as militant even as t the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will not lose their interest between the issues of a weekly organ; and for the most  part we can conceive of the interest being intensified by the interven- ing discussion and the waiting to hear the voice of the church through ENDENTRY 8  its organ.  We know that some obstacles obtrude themselves against the changes proposed. These consist chiefly of the papers and magazines that it is proposed to displace, and the interest of the owners of the  same - something not to be lightly cast aside. Next, the sentiment which stands behind and that is connected with these publications. Yet we cannot regard these as insurmountable obstacles. We cannot con- ceive in connection with those associated either in sentiment or by business interests in the said publications as allowing sentiment or personal interest to stand in the way of the attainment of a purpose so lofty as it here suggested. And so far as the matter of business is concerned there can doubtless be such an adjustment of affairs in the necessary changes as to result in no material loss to the parties interested. We take it that perhaps the Juvenile Instructor would be  the magazine affected most and present the greatest difficulty to  overcome. The high standing and well known abilities of the editor has given it a prestige that would indeed be enviable if envy were to be  a quality admitted into such matters. Its supreme value, however,  arises from the fact that its has gone beyond the legitimate sphere indicated by its title and as the organ of the Sunday Schools. It has become recognized as the authority of the church on doctrinal subjects. This position in our judgement belongs not to an organ of one of the  auxiliary institutions of the church but to the church itself and to the organ of the church. And if the editor of the Juvenile Instructor became, as in our judgement he ought to become, the editor in chief of  the proposed organ of the church, his abilities would find a wider  scope, his influence a broader range for its operation, for it would be transferred from the organ of a subordinate organization of the church to the organ of the church itself. Such a weekly religious ENDENTRY 9  newspaper-magazine as is here proposed with such an editor would at once obtain - and largely through his national reputation and influence -  a national and even international standing, and in our judgement his  ability to give such prestige to an organ or the church ought not to be much longer delayed. And in the wider sphere to which this work  would call his abilities and matured judgement he would find recompense for seeing the publication to which he has devoted years of care and attention and personal means merged into the greater work proposed.  Reading again what is here set down, we are well-nigh startled at the boldness of a suggestion of so wide a scope and affecting  so many interests; and yet we feel confident that our brethren will not  misunderstand us or take exceptions to our suggestions. It has all grown out of the consideration of the propriety of starting a new  magazine to represent the Y. M. M. I. Associations. Believing that ulti- mately the church will of necessity concentrate its efforts in supplying the saints with periodical literature, and will have to have a church organ of the character herein contemplated. We are of the opinion that the launching of a new magazine would lead away rather than toward  the accomplishment of this desirable object, and therefore we have taken  the liberty of writing this communication and hope that it will receive careful attention at the hands of the Presidency and the Apostles at as early a date as possible, and that we shall hear as soon as may be the conclusion arrived at. For ^If^ the changes herein suggested, or some plan that would be equivalent to them shall be adjudged impracticable, then we desire to resume the drafting of the prospectus of the new  magazine for the Y. M. M. I. A., as the condition of those societies re- quire that the superintendency shall have some medium of communication with them.  Very truly your brethren,  ENDENTRY Heber J. Grant  B. H.

Q. Cannon. and Pres. J. F. Smith.  Dear Brethren;  Pres. Elmina S.  Taylor desires to prepare a  Circular Letter for distribution among the Societies as to the scope  and necessity of the work we  have understaken in the pub- lication of the Y. W.'s Journal. It is difficult for women to launch out in new fields, no matter how important that work may be. Especially in this ENDENTRY the case in entr such an enterprize as printing a magazine. But because we felt it would further the Work of God, and serve to enlighten and  stimulate the latent nobility of  our young women, were we impelled to move out in this direction. It will not become me to remind you  of the many years of success which establishes the other Church Publica- tions on a sound basis, but I will simply ask you for some of that  religious support, which certainly women and women's enterprizes deserve at the hands of the leading men of the Church, the Priesthood. Will you forgive me if I mention the fact that the Deseret News is  officered by the Highest Authority, the Juvenile Instructor has as  Editor one of the First Presidency and  as manager one of the Twelve Apostles, ENDENTRY the Contributor is published under the Auspices of the Association which claims the Pres. of the Church as its  controlling Officer, with the Third of  the ^First^ Quorum as the first Counsellor and another of the Twelve Apostles as the Second Counsellor. Do such publications as these evere need a  Testimonal as to their usefulness or as a gaurentee to the people who are desired to subscribe to their support? The Exponent was established by Brigham Young, who was never unwilling to give it all the moral and religious support of his name and influence. ENDENTRY Our little magazine stepped forth unheralded by mighty names,  although thank God! it was sanc- tioned and approved by the highest Authority, in private.  We have wished to bring this matter  before the whole Church, viz: that the Young Woman's Journal is ap- proved by God through His Authorized Servants. It is not an individual concern, it is not working for anything or any body but the  interests of the Y. L. M. I. A. and  the Church and Kingdom of God.  Dear Brethren, in what way can Sister Taylor's desire be granted? She thought a Circular Letter to the Associations to which could  be added a few Testimonials from the Presidency and leading brethren would reach the end she desired, and forever quiet those ENDENTRY who seem to feel there is no use nor mission for the Journal in Zion.  If any other mode of accomplishing the matter would better meet your  approval, I have her assurance that she will be perfectly satisfied.  I think our leading brethren have  little idea how much weight thier names (especially if standing at the head of an Enterprize) have with the masses of the people. However, what we desire is to have an unquestionable testimony that the Journal is sanctioned by the  First Presidency.  If you can feel to give a brief  Testimonial, you will greatly ENDENTRY oblige Pres. Elmina S. Taylor as well as Your humble servant  Susa Young Gates.  Susa Y.

I told them that I have had no charges to make against the  school, and that the purport of my remarks at Sis. Dougall's that night of our meeting was to place myself before the Presidency in a correct light; for I feared that the story  of the immorality of the 16 young men at  the Academy had grown out of the story  I told in a private meeting held at Sis. Taylor's.  It seems that I didnot succeed as I  wished; and I greatly desire the opportunity of meeting with the First Presidency and  repeating my story, which I endeavored to tell before.  In fact the Executive Com. have ENDENTRY appointed me to do this, and Bro. Reed Smoot, a member of the Com. is to ac- company me on this mission. I would like to ask one of or two of the sisters to  who were present at the two meetings I have referred to, to accompany us also.  It is extremely painful to me to  feel that I have been understood as  casting opprobrium on the Academy,  a thing I would avoid at all hazards.  May I^Bro. Smoot and I^ beg for as speedy an interview with yourself and Counsellors as possible; for a telegram or note will call us at once to the City, as soon as you can see us.

SUSA YOUNG GATES, Editor. P. O. Box 200.  Provo City, Dec. 267th 1889  Pres. W. W. Woodruff; My mother has just re- turned from a visit to Cache Co. in the interest  of the Young Women's Journal.  Many reports, she tells me, have reached  her during her travels there as well as in  Wasatch Co. of certain adverse criticisms passed  on the Journal by Bro. Wm Palmer, who is I  believe the accredited agent of the Contributor.  At length, while in Hyrum at the house  of Sister Jane E. Molen, mother was introduced  to the gentleman as the agent of the Journal,  which opened a short conversation in which  he stated to her that "the printing of the  Y. W.'s Journal was a mistake; the Author- ities had of the Church had authorized the  ENDENTRY publishing of the "Contributor" to be the rep- resentative of both the Associations."  Many little things might be repeated from Rumor, but I do not wish to seem to express a feeling of anger, or enmity to the Con- tributor, its Editor or agents; we are all working in the same field can we not do so in peace  and fraternity?  In this connection I might mention the re Editorial in the Contributor of Oct. 1889, which I wish might be read before you dismiss this matter; as,  although carefully worded, it conveys the idea es- pecially taken with Bro. Palmer's expressions that the Authorities of the Church formally installed  the Contributor as official Organ of both Associations which arrangement according to Bro. Junius's  Editorial still remains.  I dislike to see, much less to augment, any  disunion or discord, any spirit of rivalry or petty jealousy between our two organizations  and therefore approach this matter in humility and prayer. While I do not feel to allow the ENDENTRY matter to run on unquestioned as it is proving a decided injury to our perhaps humble but  still earnest endeavors to elevate the intellectual standing of Our Girls—yet I have no feeling of anger or spite against any one in the Con- tributor employ.  I trust you may find it necessary to make this matter a public one, at least sufficient to  set us right before the Associations scattered throughout Zion. It must certainly look to the girls as if Sister Taylor is moving forward in a direction unauthorized by the presiding Authorities of the Church.  I wish I might say to Bro.'s Junius Wells and Wm Palmer, come brethren, let us dwell together in Unity. For the man is not ENDENTRY without the woman in Christ. You have your own noble sphere, fill it, and leave to  us our sphere as wide and pure as yours, if  not in the same direction always. Respect us, as we do you, and remember that your whip lash is so long, and we are necessarily so near you that your blows will not only  smart on our shoulders, but wrap around your own legs. Still another reminder, if I may continue my metaphor, the woman—our interests—will only look up to and respect her  lord—thier interests—when her proves himself in all things worthy to lead her.  Mother desires me to express her sorrow that she should be the innocent means of  this unfortunate affair, as she entertains a  high esteem for Bro. Palmer.

Dear Brethren:  We received your communication of 18th of last month, several days ago which occasioned us some little alarm, owing to our peculiar situation. There are not one of the boys, but whom are willing to do all they can towards the consumation of so noble a work--an in fact have so ex- pressed themselves in my hearing--bro. Claw- son, in particular, said that it was the  heighth of his ambition to do something in this temple but would want much more time than that given in which to do such  work and a chance to complete his studies here before undertaking it, according to ^his^ desire expressed in our other letter. As far as  I myself am concerned, I will be ready to  start for home when I receive the money I de- sire to go to Italy and see the works of art there ENDENTRY as I think such a trip would be profitable and educative to me. I named the amount in other letter and will do so again in this one: $450.00 I wish to purchase some material to work with when I get home, which I can do to better advantage here I also desire to pur- chase a decorative work and a book of cos- tumes which is ^are^ to be had here, and are very  popular ^among^ and reliable for art students. I will also have to purchase some clothes, as I am get- ting shabby. all of which I think I can do out of  above amount including my fare home.  The other boy's desires and intentions are substantially the same as expressed in our  former letter, as to the time they wish to remain here.  You cannot realize, brethren, our true situtation, but would undoubtedly sympathise with us if you were to come here and take a look at the work in the Salon, the decorations in the  Louvre, Pantheon Hotel de Ville, and other public edifices, consider the time and experience it has has taken to do them ^and then^ compare it with the few months given us in which to do a similar class  of work. Rushcross, who exhibited in last  year's salon, was three years doing his paint- ENDENTRY -ing. Laurrens, one of our professors, I am told was several years designing and painting one of his decorations in the Panth- -eon and there is a painting in the salon this year which we were informed took the ar- tist eight years to do. Many of the spaces ^in some of these buildings^ are still vacant awaiting the completion and  maturity of the artist's designs, which have  been underway for years. With these facts staring us in the face you can easily un- derstand out timidity, and need not be sur- prised at our alarm when called upon to do such an important work as may be required in  the House of the Lord.  Bros. Haag are still going to school. Bro. Fairbanks and I are copy- ing in the Luxemburg and Louvre. Bro.  Evans had another drawing chosen for the concour. Bro. Clawson is working in a pri- vate studio. We feel that our progress has  been good and acknowledge that the Lord has been with us to a great extent.  Mr. J. T. Harwood of Lehi who has had one years schooling in America and three in Paris, like Mr. Dallin in sculpture ENDENTRY has met with success in painting his work having been accepted in this year's salon and an honorable number (3) given it. He is not  a member of the church but a steady honorable young man and a son of Utah. We are  proud of him as a worthy compatriot in  art and hope that he will be a benefit to the Territory. He, and his wife sail for home on  the 7th of this month.  The boys all join in love to your- selves and the brethren.  Hoping that you will send money without delay as all are getting low, I re- main  Your Brother in the  Gospel  Lorus Pratt  P. S. Please name the amounts for each the next time you send the money (as I will need the full amount named above if I go to Italy) in order to avoid confusion.

Dear Brother,  By request of the Bishop and several leading broth- eren of Springville, and with the consent of President Smoot of this Stake, I went to Springville in the  morning of Sunday, Novemb. 6, for the purpose of addresing the Saints there in the interest of a church- school, and to meet with the Board of the proposed institution. After having met with the Sunday- schools, and the general meeting in the forenoon and afternoon respectively, a special meeting fold in the interest of the new school was appoin- ted for the evening, which was attended by par- ents and going to lay before them the spirit and in- tent of such schools and the necessity of having the youth of Zion educated upon the principles of the Gospel as a foundation for all learning. The Board have fitted up the Seventies Held of Springville in a very creditable manner for school purposes, and have engaged, upon my recommendation, Bro. Sinson Eggertsen, ENDENTRY of Academy, formerly Principal of the Lehi Districts schools, and Super- intendent of Sunday and schoolsthere, until he went on his mission to the Eastern States, from which he returned last year. Bro. Eggertsen commenced his labors the following morning with 55 pupils  of the V. and W Reader grades, according to a Plan and Programme previously arranged bet- ween us. The apering ceremonies were quite im- pressive, condnoted by the Bishop Packard, his Counsellers, and members of the Board.

Meantime,  however, various conditions in some of these schools are kept in obeyance bending your final instructions. As an illustration I enclose a letter from Bro.

Academy prevent me to comply with this cordial imitation, I have  written them a congratulatory letter. Bro.

As soon the school is fairly started, I expect a report from the Prin- cipal, which I shall forward to you, or in synapsis, according to its nature. This has suggested to me the idea to have complete reports furnished from all existing churches schools, as material for your consideration and future direction. If you should approve of this, I should be happy to receive your instructions in regard to all the ENDENTRY points you desire to be put into the schedule, and I will forward a copy each to Logan, Academy, to be filled out, with perhaps a few additional  points of my own suggestion regarding dayboorks.

Forgive me Dear President Woodruff President Smith for mentioning the things I have done, but I am now in the Greatest distress of my life for my Wife and childrens Home, And I pray you to help mee, and I will deed the property to you, or in any other way you say  I never received any thing for the first Organ, it was used a great many years, and therefore may I not ask you to help me now.

Ridges ENDENTRY considerably among the various stakes, and have  opportunities of becoming acquainted with those who  are most suitable in these stakes for missionaries.  By keeping in mind or noting down in their memorandum books the wants of the various fields, they  can learn by conversation with the Presidency of the Stakes  and with Bishops, who there are that might answer to  go as missionaries, to the various places requiring their presence. They should also as far as practicable see and converse with those individuals themselves, and take down the names of those who should strike them as being suitable, with their qualifications and their cir- cumstances. Then when you get together in council you can from these names select missionaries for the various fields to supply the demand. By taking this course we think the best men in the community illegible in positions to go on missions, can be selected, and greater Efficiency be imparted to our missionary illegible.  There are many considerations which should enter  into the selection of missionaries; these the Twelve are familiar with. Sickly men or men who are crippled or defficient in physical stamina, are not the kind of  men to send away from home. The Seventies, especially  ENDENTRY should not permit themselves to become so embarrassed  by debt that they cannot go when called, but should so  shape their affairs that they could go at any time without  difficulty. Where men are loaded down with debt, illegible to some other peculiar circumstances which prevent them  going at once, they should have time given them to arrange their affairs, so that they will not have to make too great sacrifices. Indeed all missionaries who are called should have a reasonable time allowed them to make proper  arrangements for the care of their families, and of their business while they are absent.  If the Twelve adopt this course, they will be in a  position to suggest names of suitable persons whenever a  call for missionaries is made. At the same time the operation of the Preciding Council of Seventies in se- curing names need not be suspended. But the Council  of the Apostles should exercise a supervisory care over these nominations, and learn all that is possible respecting the men suggested, so that unworthy representatives of our cause shall not go out. We have been impressed with the need of greater care in this direction.  You should make your arrangements, that if a  sudden call should come for a missionary or missionaries, ENDENTRY that whoever may be in the F. D. Richards and others can make the desired selection and supply the call.) Elders who may find it necessary to go away ,  can also report to them and if suitable can be appointed  We may say while upon this subject that though we salut the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association   and think the organizations capable of performing great good, we do not think it proper to apply to their President to select names for missions. This belongs properly to the Priesthood and its various quorums, and should be attended to by those who preside over them  In connection with this subject, the circumstances of the men who are called ought to be taken into con- sideration. Men ought not to be obliged to break up  their affairs to go upon missions and have themselves  without either house or home while there are plenty of  others who could go without being embarrassed.  Your consideration is requested also to a subject which has been mentioned for several years past the providing for the families of men who may be sent on missions. In Sannock, Oneida, Cache and some few other stakes some of the wards have purchased and set ENDENTRY apart lands of from 110 to 160 acres to be cultivated for the purpose of sustaining missionaries' families who may need assistance. The design is to have this cul- tivation done by the Seventies and other Elders who, for various reasons do no go on missions abroad. In this way the missionaries, during their absence, can be freed in a great measure from the care and sustainance of their families.  This principle, if carried out throughout all the Stakes and Wards, would greatly relieve many of the missionaries and their families during their absence.  It is designed that this plan shall be thoroughly carried out in all the stakes of Zion. The Presidents of stakes have been written to upon this subject, and if the Twelve in their labors in the stakes can urge the completing of this arrangement it would greatly re- lieve many missionaries from embarrassments un- der which they now labor. Let this plan be properly carried out, and many who are now qualified ^to go^ on mis- sions, but cannot well leave their families on  account of their want of means to sustain them during ENDENTRY their absence, will be able to go and their families can  be made tolerably comfortable. We think it a duty that we owe to the Seventies, Elders and others who are ingaged in missionary labors and ought not to be put off any longer. It is several years since this was first instituted,  but we are afraid that in many parts is has been very litile attended to, and it is a measure and a duty that should not be overlooked, for anything that  can be done towards facilitating this labor, is a duty de- volving upon us to accomplish.

Dear Brother:  In the fall of 1885, I received word from Bro. Richards to assist him at this office. I was attend- ing the University, had been very successful in my studies, and calculated to graduate the following Spring.  I left everything, came and labored with Bro. Richareds; and as my father, who was a noble, Godfearing man, said to me on his dying bed; "John, you stay with Bro. Franklin, he is a good man," I have rejected other good situations to keep my promise. And above all, I have now fulfilled an honorable mission for such was the call from Bro. R. and fell to thank my heavenly Father for the good influence I have been in  This afternoon, I conversed with Bro. R. at whose instance I write you this letter. He said he was sorry; but something may, in the future "turn up."  He said for me to "continue in the office until next Thurday evening, attend to the mission- aries, ect then give the keys to Bro. Jaques". Which I will do. Staving so short a notice, having heard of closing up the 23th of last month, today, consummated.  I am left in debt with cash obligations. I ask, will ENDENTRY you let me know if I may draw the remainder of my pay, $97 00/100 in cash, or even apart to coin my obligations, for I am now left without work, and when I may get into another position I cannot say.

Dear Brethren: The General Board of the Deseret Sunday School Union respectfully repre- sent. That they have heard that the Church has generously contributed $5,00000, besides other material aid, to the Young Men's Mutual Im- provement Associations to enable the general authorities of those organizations to publish certain works etc. for the benefit of the youth of Zion.  That the Sunday School Union has been in existence now about 20 years, has never yet asked any assistance from the Church, and that it numbers five times as many sould as the Improvement Association, (or about 60,000 officers and scholars.) ENDENTRY (2)  That during the period of its existence it has been self-sustaining, neither seeking finan= cil aid from the Church, nor imposing an assessment upon the schools, but out of its own resources has published at ver low prices, a number of books, cards, music, etc. and also donted to aid foreign missions, the brethren in the penitentiary, etc.  That at the present time, owing to the growth and development of the Sunday Schools, other pub= lications, books, music, wall maps, charts, etc, are urgently called for, which the Union is not in a position to provide.  In consideration of these circumstances, and the great work which the Union and the Sunday Schools are accomplishing among the children of the Saints, and emboldened by the very liberal response made by the Church to the requests of the Mutual Improvement Asso= ciations, we now respectfully petition the First Presidency to grant us such substantial, finan= cial aid as the condition of the Church may permit, and the needs of the Sunday School cause may suggest. ENDENTRY (3)  As the Church may be somewhat embar= rassed for funds, and may therefore not be in a position to respond to this request by advan= cing money, we have a proposition to make which, we trust will prove acceptable under present circumstances.  It is that the nine mem= bers composing the Board of the Sunday School Union be permitted to advance their tithing for the year, 1889, for the porpose of aiding the Sun= day School cause, and that they each receive tithing receipts for the amounts that they individ= ually pay.  Trusting that our petition will not be deemed improper; and that you will see your way clear to grant us the desired aid, we re= main, very respectfully; on behalf of the Sun= day School Union of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,  Your Brethren, John C.

I am in love with art and have been all my life I feel that I could scarcely live without it, And were it not for seeing my family suffer I could work at it unceasingly, "it seems I would never tire", I believe I could work at art and take pleasure in starving if it came through sticking to my work.  It almost seems that the ^what^ knowl edge of art I have attained has unqualified me for other work.

If it is not too late I will give some of mine ^views^ now, if the two rooms to be decorated are to be so painted, as to represent the Garden and the world of course they will ^each^ have to ^be^ painted under the same general effect.  This it seems to me would be very difficult for several paint- ers to do, unless one would paint trees another rocks another animals ect, and even then I fear there would be a lack of harmony but I do not know that there would be, If the decorations are to represent the garden and the world, and not the rooms them selves, each artist who is ENDENTRY 4  cent I am informed that the B.

My dear brethren when I think  of the work to be done in the temple it makes me quake and tremble. My inability stares me in the face to such an extent that at times I have thought I would not make a sketch at all, but content myself with doing what might be assigned me Then again I think if I can work on some one eles' design why not on my own should it be accepted,  It might seem strange that after two years study a man ENDENTRY 5  when I get things of this kind it makes me wild to get at the people and to tell them what I know of Art but I have no means by which I can do this and if I had I do not know that the people would listen,  I have often thought that perhapse it would be a good plan to go East or West among strangers and seek employment, but this takes me from my family Then I have thought perhapse I could find employment as a canvasere of some good book or something else and thus make money enough to last a while then go back to my profession again ENDENTRY is not qualified for almost any work that might be required of him, but no one knows what there is to be learned in art till he has undertaken it, I think our progress has been as rapid as any in the Academy but we knew so little when we came that it took us a long time to get where the others usuall start.

I am perfectly willing to go wherever I may be called to go and to do what- ever I possibly can do, but as far as I now can see, I do not see may way clear to undertake the journey, which I, were it otherwise, would delighte in doing.  When I first conceived the idea of translating the book, I thought that I perhaps might obtain permission ENDENTRY to print and circulate here in Utah first and that you would allow a sufficient number of copies to cover all the expences of this first edition. Afterwards, I thought, every copy should be sold for the benefit of the church. This I thought I could do by asking the Swidish Saints to subscribe for the book.  I again take the libirty of sub- mitting the question to your con= sideration.  If you should deem it advisable to call me over to Europe to see to the printing of the work, I will gladly go, provided I be put in a condition, financialy, to do so.  And in that case I will ask as a favor to hear about it as early as possible, that I may take ENDENTRY make some preparations.  In the meantime I will continue my translation, wherever I have an opportunity.  I have now trans- lated about fifty pages, and can assure you that the delighte I take in the work is great.

Carlsson of the Co-op store my manuscript of the Book of Doc. and Cov. in the Swedish language, and also a letter directed to you, which br. Carlsson kindly prom- ised to forward.  Having heard nothing whatever since then about the manuscript, I thought I would, if you will par- don me, trouble you again with a few lines on the subject.  I am anxiously waiting to hear your deciscion about the printing of the manuscript.  If, as you intimated in your last letter, it is likely that I shall be called ENDENTRY to go to the city and stay while the book is being printed, it would be a great favor to me, if I could know it without much more delay. For a long as this is undecided, I can not very well take any steps towards securing me something to do, something I must look to, soon.  I would like to see the book printed first though, before I do anything else, and I earnestly hope, you will give me the privilege of revising the manuscript before going to press, whether the printing be done in Salt Lake City or (what would probably be cheaper and in some respects better) you would allow me to print it here at Manti.  I have also a request to make, that whatever you will allow me for the translation, you would now be pleased to let me have as soon as possible, as I really need ENDENTRY Nephi, February 21st 1888.

Dear brother,  I thought I would now send you this to let you know that I anticipate having the Swedish translation of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants completed in a bout two or perhaps three weeks, and also to ask you what you wish me to do with it when completed.  Shall I send it to brother Carlson or to somebody else for perusel and revision?  As the whole work has been exe= cuted with the same care as the speciman fomerly sent to Br. Carlson, and as I have acted upon the suggestions threw words by him, I trust the work will be accepted, and when printed be themeans of doing much good.

It might be worth while consideration if the printing could not conveniently be done at Liverpool, where the Church owns an office.  In London, I am afraid that we might meet with obstacles, the press laws of country being rather strict, and in Denmark the church does not own an office, but has to pay outsiders for the work.  I firmly believe ENDENTRY that the printing would be done almost as cheap  at Copenhagen, where the greatest part of our Scandivanian publications are printed.  However this matter and some others in connection with the work I would like to discuss with someone, authorised by you, and would be thankful if an opoortunity were given me to do so.  With respect to the copyrighte to the translation, I can only say that it was my idea from the beginning to let the church have that, and the terms I leave to you to propose.  I wish I would have done this work without any consideration.  But as an independent position has not been my lot, the Lord wold not require those.  I have come to this country, however, not to gather wealth,so that I am easily satisfied I have been working at the ^book^ since the latter part of November as much as time has allowed me.

When my account was credited up at the reduced rate, it left me in debt eight hundred dollars, as four years had elapsed from the previous settlement, which amount I still owe the church.  I would respectfully ENDENTRY arrange for me in some way or other, so that I could stay where the book is printed, while the printing is going on. The first proofs could then be submitted to br.

Dear Bro,  Yours of Aug 9th reached me just before I left a letter from Bro.

The letter circum- stance has caused me to feel that the Institution at Provo was well provided with teachers for the coming year.  I understood your letter to be a release, leaving my association with the B. Y. Academy to myself, and not a special call to labor in that particular institution and so I hope stopped along the way to visit cities and places of historical and scientific importance that I might be better qualified as a teacher in Zion ENDENTRY Had your letter been a call to labor in the I would of course hasten ed home in obedience and honor of the Priesthood. My heart is naturally enough in the welfare and prosperity of the Academy, an institution alone; but as long as Bro. Talmage remains I have not felt that my immediate presence was so necessary there. I shall probably reach home sometime the middle of Decem- ber I have a number of visits of an educational character to make, and I re- juice in the opportunities which I know God has placed with in my reach and which more thoroughly qualify me as a teacher. I very much desire to be associated again with my family and the saints, but feel that duty admanishes me to be patient. The work in Palestine is chiefly among the Germans, members of colonists styled Templars. There are still many fine people among them whose timidity has pre- sented them thus far from examining ENDENTRY the gospel. We have a few very good fam- ilies in the church and that part of the  mission is now self supporting. I think a somewhat experienced German, a sivabian of forty-five or fifty could be very useful. The colonists would then have a warning and testimony  from three elders. Bro. Hintze will  by spring be qualified to go into Armnia for the purpose of carrying out the plans devised for getting the Gospel before that  nation. I relaize that I have accomplished  but very little, especially when considered from the extent of your own missionary experience. I have however, many testimo- nies of God's goodness and of the divinity of  this work. Pres. Teasdale in his letter releasing me from my labors said I was at liberty to return at lisure and I shall be very happy to know that the course I am pursuing is approved by you.

If the Church will pay the necessary expenses, I desire to return this fall for another two years to devote my while time for decorative paintings, historical and ideal, such as may be required for our temples or other public buildings as you shall decire.

I have seen his bare foot and know whereof I speak. He has been out of employment since last May. He has 4 or 5 children to, ^sustain^ and expects shortly to have another.  He has no pauperized feelings about him. He simply wants to live and sustain himself by honest industry, in anything he is capable of performing.

A few days ago, as I was coming from the High Priests Meeting, I was much humiliated, (as a member of the Church) by the emblazioned announcement, in Main St, carried by boys, of a Foot ball game contest, between the Latter day saint College students, and those of some other institution. But thanks to the unanimous vote, and stand, taken by the members of the stake board of education, who resolved that, that game should not come off, although advertized; and it did not; I sincerely hope, that such an unmista^ca^ble impression was made, not only on the Presiding Authority of the College, but the students themselves, that will for ever prevent its resurrection.  On my way to Lehi yesterday, my attention was directed to the large head lines, in the "Tribune." Was a slugging match, Ended in a row.  ENDENTRY from the fact, that the First Presidency are generally supposed to be individually inter ested financially or otherwise connected with it, together with other members of the church renders the matter all the ^more mysterious and bewildering for the Latter day saints to solve.

Some Missionaries and Bishops also warn the saints both old ^and young to keep awau from all such resorts on the sabbath day.  After listening to these solemn warn -ings then in the Deseret News, the avowed organ of the Church to read such glowing announcements as per enclosed strip, it is no wonder at the many questions being asked by both young and old, the meaning of such contradictions.

As I cannot conceive of one particle of good, arising from indulgencies in either Yells, or Foot ball games, but I can see a great amount of evil, therefore my voice and influence will always be in favor of their utter abandonment, by all latter day saints.  Please receive these sentiments, as the honest impressions of my heart. And praying for the Lord to so guide, and direct you in this matter that will most advance the righteousness of his kingdom.  I remain Your friend and Brother  George Goddard ENDENTRY latter day saints are indulging in I cannot imagine a stronger reason to exist for Latter day saints to cease patronizing a paper, that admits into its columns such soul destroy -ing traps to the young of Zion, as indicated by the enclosed strip, when compared to its high sounded professions, as per larger strip enclosed.  I cannot imagine a more humiliating picture for Latter day saints to face than this, and in creating more bewildering comment on its faith destroying influence, than anything that ever occured before in the history of the church.  For such a programme to be attempted to be carried out in any hall or building in this City, the moral and religious portiont of the com- munity would be aroused enmasse, and would never permit such an outrage to be tolerated during the peaceful hours of the sabbath.  And the fact of its existance being a few miles distant in the suburbs, renders it no less obnoxious and sinful before God and Man.  If anything can be done to effectually wipe out ENDENTRY the stain that had been inflicted on the purity of our faith, and the injury to the cause of Zion already sustained, my object will be accomplished.

Woodruff and Council  Dear Brethren  For your sanction and blessing I respectfully submit a few more suggestions on the subject of organizing a Temperance Society among the Latter day saints.  Since I last approached you on the subject, increased facilities and temptations have arisen in our midst, including Union Clubs, Bathing resorts, Election Clubs, andc, all of which haveing a tendency of strengthening, and enticing, the body and soul destroying use of Tobacco and Strong Drink. Tis true, there are one or more Temperance Organizations in our midst, and some of our brethren, (by their influence) have been snatched from a drunkards grave, and are now, in their right mind and become respected members of society.

Woodruff and Council My dear Brethren/ shorthand The near completion of our Temple The rapidity and importance of passing events, and more especially the growing habit of using Tobacco and intoxicating drinks by the youth of Israel, have borne with considerable weight upon my mind, until a settled conviction has forced itself upon me, that some special effort was needed at the present time, as a check and preservation from this dreadful condition.  I firmly believe that the inaugeration of a Latter day saint Temperance Society would produce a wonderful reformation not only amongst the youth, but the d  adult portion of our community.  The "Word of wisdom has been preached so long, until it has actually become distasteful to many. ENDENTRY similar Institutes in our midst for the purpose of destroying the unnatural taste that long accustomed habit had created for strong st drink. This timely check, however good and praiseworthy, is costing the community many thousands of dollars.  Every philanthropic effort, organized for the express purpose of influencing the youth to abstain from such soul and body destroying habits, I hail with joy and gratitude to my heavenly father, and award a meed need of praise toward all those who labor with such unselfish motives to benefit their fellow creatures. But all such efforts fall far short of the needed remedy.  God our heavenly father, realizing the degenerating habits of the present generation, has kindly detailed those hygienic principles, embodied ^in^ the word of wisdom, (as a key) for his servants to use, towards effecting a thorough reformation, not only in the midst of his people, but extend a universal invitation to all the children of Adam; of no creed, and every creed to come and partake with us the blessing of  ENDENTRY I would suggest the embodyment of the senti- ments contained in the "Word of Wisdom", and to meet the present condition of society, in the form of a pledge as follows.  "I promise to abstain from the use of Tea, Coffee, Cigarettes, Tobacco and all intoxicating drinks", also to use meats of all kinds very sparingly.  Such a society would not only commend itself to all real latter day saints, but tower above the pettifogging efforts of Christiandom in their Temperance movement, who confine their ammunication against the use of intoxicants only and leaving their converts the privilege of indecl -ging in the health destroying use of Tobacco Cigarettes Tea, Coffee, and all the meat they choose.  A society based on the principles I suggests would command the respect and sanction of the most influential pracitiones of medical science.  And not a man of inferior note would dare to scoff or proclaim against it, for fear of exposing their ignorance, and lose what little influence they now possess. ENDENTRY increased health and longevity.  My suggestion is this, with a view of forming a gigan- tic schemic of Temperance reform, let a meeting be called for the advocacy of broad and advanced princi- ples, with the purpose of stemming the tide of wicked- ness resulting from the3 smoking and drinking customs of the country, let all lovers of humanity be invited.  Let the names of the organization be of a distinctive character, for instance "The rocky mountain Temper- ance Society" or, "The great latter day Temper- ance Society," and under its broad banner, at least two pledges or promises for the admission of mem- bers, one, "I hereby promise to abstain from the use of st strong drink and tobacco," another, I hereby promise to abstain from the use of tea,  coffee, tobacco and strong drink.  Both of these pledges will receive the signatures of thousands of latter day saints in all parts of the world. They will become a stay and a staff to them, as a strengthener to their memory, precisely on the same principle, as the signing of a promisory ENDENTRY We are catering for the inhabitants of the universe, and in aiming to stem the torrent of inequity and vice, so much of which springs ^frum^ the use of strong drink, our Temperance effort should, as far exeel theirs, as do the first princi ples of the gospel excel the religious vagaries of the age.  The revelations of the Keeley Institute are simply appalling. Who could ^have^ thought that so many victims of both male and female six, of this direful habit, could have been found in thie community Having so far expressed myself, I will now ask the question.  Will you permit me, or some one else better qualified to inaugerate a Latter day saint Temperance Society?  accompanied with your sanction, faith, and blessing.  I do not think that such a society could exist any great length of time without embracing tens of thousands of our community withint its folds.  It would simply be presenting the Word of  ENDENTRY note at a bank, our word not usually sufficient to satisfy bankers, but our bond is demanded, and one or more signatures demanded ^required^. Thus our memory is strengthened to meet our obligation on the day it falls due. Let the organization have its head quarters in Salt Lake City, and branch ones all over the world, the same as our Sunday Schools.  Thus the latter day saints will take the lead in this as in all other movements that promises the ameliora- tion of mans condition upon the earth.  Your kind and patient consideration of the above suggestions will be duly appreciated by a well wisher to the cause of Zion  George Goddard ENDENTRY wisdom in a new drass; and if by so doing, many more converts might be made, I dont think the Lord would object, for we never ^knew of him interposing any objection to his servants Paul, who indulged in a little guile in accom- plishing more good, than he could have donwe without it.  Your Brother in the Gospel George Goddard ENDENTRY George Goddard Dec. 12 1892  Salt Lake City Decr 12 1892  Prest W. Woodruff and Council / Brethren / By per mission I will lay before you a few thoughts, suggested by observation. In offering up, the opening and closing prayer before public congregations, in the blessing of the bread and water over the sacrament Table andc, I have noticed a great variety of habit by the Elders on such occasions, some hold up the right hand only, others the left hand only, some keep both hands down while others hold both hands uplifted. This lack of uniformity presented before public audiences, Sunday after Sunday, (while there is no principle or doctrine of the Gospel involved) yet so unseemly a variety I must say, conflicts somewhat with my feelings and ENDENTRY love of uniformity.  A few months ago, one of the brethren having noticed the same variety, presented it before the priesthood meeting of this Stake for solution, one of the Presidency responded, by saying that it was one of those unimportant items that the Lord had not seen fit to say anything about in our day, and therefore we need not worry about it. Though not in the same words, the answer, as I understood it, amounted to the same.  I have noticed, that when in a distinct, loud tone of voice, an Elder pronounces verbatim the prayer that was formulated for that purpose, to be used at the sacrament table, how much more grateful to the multitude of listeners than in a moment of for- getfulness, he should branch off in language of his own.  And when the habit of forgetfulness seemed to be more the exception ^rule^ than the rule ^exceptoiion^, printed forms were sug- gested, to avoid the variety, and secure uniformity of speech.  When King David was in the enjoyment of the spirit of God, and in the midst of his devotional element, ENDENTRY We find the following passages.  ##Psalm 28:2|Psalm 28.2##.

April 20, 1897  President Wilford Woodruff and Counselors Dear Brethren:-- A letter from Judge Judd Chairman of the Tennessee Centennial Commission, received yesterday morning, contained the request that I leave here by next train for Salt Lake, to help get the Utah Exhibit together for shipment to Nashville, and my transportation to Salt Lake and return was enclosed.  I prepared to depart but hardly felt justified without a word from you.  I understood that I was to labor under the direction of the Commission at Nashville and did not feel that it means a return to Utah even temperarilly, so I telegraphed last night asking your consent to the trip home, puting off my departime 24 hours. I have heard nothing from you and it being two hours from train time I hasten to drop this note of explanation to say that my best judgment leads me to go - as every hour now counts much for our exhibit.

Pyper Apl. 20/97 ENDENTRY These passages of scripture are not quoted, as suggestive of any obligation that we as Latter day saints are under to either Moses, but I do think, they are strikingly suggestive of a becoming attitude for a servant of God to assume when he stands up in the presence of a large congregation as their mouth piece to supplicate our Almighty Father for blessings, not only for those present, but all the house of Israel.  And in this connexion I am also a strong advocate, for the whole congregation uniting in loud response, Amen as so strongly urged by President Jospeh F. Smith, at our recent conference.  From the quaker like silence that usually prevails after a prayer has been offered, for, and in their behalf, the whole congregation may have been fast asleep, during its presentation, as far as any outward manifestation proving to the contrary.

The translation of that book is superior to that of the book of Mormon There are about 25 Revelations, which will have to be translated, as they were not contained in the old book.  I must aknolledge that in doing this work, I have been blessed in my labors, for which I feel thank- full.
