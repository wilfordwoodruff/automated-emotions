Enclosed please find letter from Bro. [[Jacob Spori|Jacob Spori]] at<br/>

I had been consulted by you for the advisability of his going <br/>
to Rexburg. I do not know a word about it.</p>

of that [[CBI|young boy]] <span class=""unclear"">[]</span> who expected to be assistant to <br/>
Bro. Spori, and to be taught by him. I am afraid the poor <br/>
boy is disconcerted about all this trouble.</p>

<p>Although Bro. Spori would have preferred not to have <br/>
this letter submitted to you, I put it my duty to do so, as <br/>
I cannot say one word in this affair without your in-<br/>
struction. Please let Bro. [[George Reynolds|Reynolds]] return Bro. Spori's<br/>
letter to me to be placed on file, when your decision is <br/>
made.</p>

<p>Dear Brother:</p>

<p>We are impressed to address you this lette<strike>h</strike>r, and to solicit your co-oper-<br/>
ation in the sugar-making enterprise which has been inaugurated lately among us. We <br/>
naturally feel reluctant to use our in<strike>o</strike>fluence with our brethren in affairs of this<br/>
kind, because we are aware of the present stringency of money matters and the many <br/>
calls that are made upon our brethren who have means, to invest in one direction and<br/>
another; but the exigency of this case calls for our active interposition in this bus-<br/>
iness. We have, in our public capacity, contributed to its stock, and have lent the<br/>
influence of our credit to aid the company in meeting its contracts. We feel the impor-<br/>
tance of establishing this industry, for it will furnish employment to a great many <br/>
hands, and also provide a market for our agriculturists to dispose of their beets. As<br/>
you are aware events have been so shaped by those who have obtained power in our <br/>
city and [[Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|county]] and elsewhere, as to deprive everyone of our faith of all public <br/>
employment, and to give the places which they occupied to those who are strangers to <br/>
our country. It seems absolutely necessary, therefore, that we sould look to the <br/>
interests of our own people, and by wise effort endeavor to establish ind<strike>n</strike>ustries which<br/>
will give them employment.</p>

<p>We believe that this sugar-making business has been examined with <br/>
care to furnish more than reasonable ground for hope that it can be made a <br/>
success in this country, not only in manufacturing sugar, but in producing good<br/>
returns for the money invested. The company has a Board of Directors who are practical <br/>
business men. They have been selected with a view to <br/>

<p>Those of us who have grown up with this country, and have been so <br/>

community that we should do our share in helping to develop home industries. In this <br/>
case, however, it is not expected that any sacrifice will be involved in purchasing <br/>
stock in the sugar company; but it is confidenty anticipated that it will prove a <br/>
good investment. We feel that the Lord is in this movement, and that it is our duty, <br/>
and the duty of this entire people, to make every exertion possible to carry out this <br/>
great branch of manufacture.</p>

I value my plant and subscription list and the <br/>

have $1,200, without further renumeration than that <br/>
I already have and am now receiving, and keep $1,000's <br/>
worth myself.  This gives the Church a controling <br/>
interest at once, leaving capital stock to the amount <br/>
of $7,800 to be disposed off as the company may deem <br/>
proper.  The proceeds of such sales could be applied<br/>
toward erecting a fire-proof building in which to store <br/>

might think proper.  I would suggest that the <br/>

endeavor to get the records through without <br/>
overweight charges. Should such <strike>m</strike>be made, however, <br/>
I have no means with me to defray the expense. <br/>
I have finished my labors in the European <br/>
Mission, with the exception of the conference in <br/>
[[Norway|Norway]]. I had expected to go there, but find <br/>
myself obliged to return at once. I have been <br/>
away over two years. My health is good, and I <br/>
feel well, though fatigued through lack of rest and <br/>
through working too many hours, perhaps, being<br/>
anxious to get through. But I shall be able to rest <br/>
while crossing the ocean. If I am required to <br/>
pay my fare from New York to Salt Lake City, my <br/>
wife will call and do so at once; but please do <br/>
not keep me waiting in New York.</p>

Mission, gathering historical notes, and visiting the diffe-<br/>
rent islands and branches of the Church in order to <br/>
obtain the desired information. Thence I went to [[Fiji|Fiji]],<br/>
where I spent ten days waiting for an opportunity to <br/>
continue my voyage to [[Tonga|Tonga]], but put in that time <br/>
to good advantage, the details of which I have already <br/>
reported to Bro. Richards. I spent three weeks with <br/>
the brethren in the Tongan Mission, and thence passed <br/>
on to [[Samoa|Samoa]], where I was busily engaged nearly a <br/>
month visiting the different islands and branches for <br/>
historical purposes, and also preaching to the people. My <br/>
next field of labor was [[New Zealand|New Zealand]], where I arrived on <br/>
Oct. 11, 1895, and commenced soon afterwards a very exten-<br/>

with Elder [[William Gardner|Wm. Gardner]], who presides over the Australa-<br/>
sian Mission. We traveled together by land and by sea <br/>
about 3000 miles, held district conferences and other <br/>
meetings in the different districts, while I at the same time <br/>
obtained my historical information and inspected the re-<br/>
spective branch and district records. On Jan. 23, 1896, I sailed<br/>

<p>Dear Brethren: Having now almost completed [[Andrew Jenson|my]] <br/>
travels (as planned a few years ago) in the various Stakes of Zion <br/>
and in all our missionary fields throughout the world (outside<br/>
the United States) this may be a fitting opportunity to make <br/>
a condensed report of my operations and travels during<br/>
the past ten years.</p>

<p>The historical labors which I have performed <br/>
directly for the Church actually commenced in 1888, when I <br/>
visited all important places connected with the history of <br/>
our people in the States of [[New York|New York]], [[Ohio|Ohio]], [[Illinois|Illinois]] and [[Missouri|Missouri]].</p>

<p>In 1889 I visited a number of the settlements of the <br/>

Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Joseph F.

The historical labors which I have performed  directly for the Church actually commenced in 1888, when I  visited all important places connected with the history of  our people in the States of Missouri.  In 1889 I visited a number of the settlements of the  Saints in Millard counties, gathering  historical information.  In 1890, for a similar purpose, I visited the  Idaho, and the  Utah.

<p>In 1895, I finished my labors in the Stakes of Zion, <br/>
and in May started on my foreign mission to continue<br/>
my labors abroad. During the remainder of the year I <br/>

<p>Your kindness, by granting the German speaking Saints in <br/>
Zion the privilege of meeting together as a German Meeting at our last<br/>
Conference, has been very highly appreciated, especially those that<br/>
<strike>s</strike>come from different parts of Zion that cannot speak the English lan-<br/>
guage yet and never have this privilege of hearing the word of God in <br/>
their own tongue. These meetings have resulted in much good, by speak-<br/>
ing of the good things which we hear at the General Conference, and by <br/>
the people meeting their friends and expressing their good feelings<br/>
and wishes to each other.</p>

<p>We therefore ask you to kindly grant us this privilege<br/>
again at our coming Conference, and also to kindly grant us the use<br/>
of the [[Assembly Hall, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Assembly Hall]]. If it does not interfere with any of your meet-<br/>

<p>Dear Bretheren I wish to know whether the <br/>
[[Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]] can be obtained for the purpose of giving a <br/>
grand concert, as Madam [[Camilla Urso|Camilla Urso]] is coming here <br/>

the arrangments for her appearance and would like to <br/>
have the use of the Tabernacle so that the masses of the <br/>

greatest living lady violinists at popular prices.</p>

<p>There are also five other musical artists with the lady <br/>
and some of our home talent could also be used.</p>

<p>I also wish to know if the Tabernacle Choir could have the <br/>
use of the Tabernacle or the [[Assembly Hall, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Assembly Hall]] in which to give <br/>
a musical entertainment which would be of a nature <br/>
suitable to the character of the building, and upon what <br/>
terms we could have it. We find that the [[Salt Lake Theater, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Theatre]] is not<br/>
at all suitable for such purposes.</p>

<p>[[Ebenezer Beesley|E. Beesley]].</p>","Salt Lake City Jan 10th 1889.  President Woodruff,  and Council of the Twelve,  Dear Bretheren I wish to know whether the  Tabernacle can be obtained for the purpose of giving a  grand concert, as Madam Camilla Urso is coming here  at the beginning of next month and Mr Kent is making  the arrangments for her appearance and would like to  have the use of the Tabernacle so that the masses of the  people could have the oppertunity of hearing one of the  greatest living lady violinists at popular prices.  There are also five other musical artists with the lady  and some of our home talent could also be used.  I also wish to know if the Tabernacle Choir could have the  use of the Tabernacle or the Assembly Hall in which to give  a musical entertainment which would be of a nature  suitable to the character of the building, and upon what  terms we could have it. We find that the Theatre is not at all suitable for such purposes.  With kind regards I am  Your Brother in the Gospel  E. Beesley."

unsatisfactory way I answered your queries yesterday I have <br/>
not felt good about it. I ought to have simply stated, that having <br/>
so many years ^enjoyed^ my privileged labors in connexion with thousands of <br/>

calling might necessitate my resignation from a position so long enjoyed, and <br/>
the performance of whose duties, afforded such unalloyed pleasure to myself, and <br/>
apparantly to tens of thousands of others, natu<strike>a</strike>rally aroused serious reflections.  <br/>
I had the impression that the two positions could not be consistently held at the same <br/>
time, viz that of a Patriarch, and the one I now hold. The assurances you gave <br/>
me yesterday entirely dissipated my erronious idea, and with thankfulness and <br/>
gratitude to my Heavenly Father for your kind consideration towards me I accept <br/>
your Ordination blessing, and pray that I may fully appreciate and enjoy all the glorious <br/>
gifts pronounced upon my head. Any suggestions or instructions you can give me<br/>

Any suggestions or instructions you can give me will be very gratefully appreciated by  Your friend and Brother in the Gospel George Goddard."

<p>To the President and Counselors of Wasatch Stake:</p>

<p>DEAR BRETHREN:- The Council of the Apostles have had under consideration the<br/>
subject of the proper remuneration for the Presidents of Stakes and their Counselors. It has<br/>
been felt for some time that where officers act in such an important position as the Presidency<br/>
of a Stake, and whose time is much engrossed with public affairs some appropriation should<br/>
be made to assist them in bearing the pecuniary burdens which rest upon them connected<br/>
with the sustenance of their families. Among other names which came up before the Council,<br/>
were yours, and it was decided to allow the President of your Stake Three<br/>
hundred- Dollars per annum, and each of the Counselors<br/>
One hundred + fifty- Dollars; these amounts to be paid<br/>
quarterly, in advance, commencing April 1st, 1888, and to be drawn in the various kinds of tithing<br/>
received, in equitable proportions. You will have sent you from my office an order to cover<br/>
those amounts, and they will be remitted to you quarterly, hereafter.</p>

<p>In making these appropriations to you, as the Presidency of the Wasatch<br/>
Stake, it is expected that you will devote your-<br/>
selves, to as great an extent as possible, to the duties of your ministry, and that you will<br/>
look strictly after the welfare of the Saints in your charge.  Difficulties and contentions<br/>
should not be allowed to grow to any size without receiving speedy attention from you.<br/>
If brethren are known to be living in an unfriendly and unbrotherly manner, you should<br/>
instruct the Bishops to see that the Teachers visit these brethren, and by their judicious<br/>
labors bring about reconciliation and such harmony of feeling as will admit of all the Saints<br/>
partaking of the Lord's Supper without condemnation.  The necessity of all the Saints dwelling<br/>
together in unity should be constantly kept before them.  No man or woman should eat the bread<br/>

The necessity of all the Saints dwelling together in unity should be constantly kept before them.  No man or woman should eat the bread and drink of the cup at the Sacrament who entertains hard feelings against any of his or her brethren and sisters.  They should be taught the importance of settling all their difficulties and"
17797,bc79038c-f784-423e-b6cd-9aa0f8cfcb8c,1888-04-06,"<p>removing all causes of, ill-feeling, so that no condemnation will rest upon them for partaking of<br/>
this holy ordinance unworthily. By paying strict attention to this, the Wards will be kept in a<br/>
healthy condition, the Spirit of the Lord will flow freely to the people, and the blessings of heaven<br/>
will be upon them.</p>

<p>Among other duties, the Saints should be carefully taught the principle of paying their<br/>
tithes strictly and punctually.  They should be impressed with its importance, for their own sakes<br/>
and for the material advantages which will come to them by a close observance of this holy law. The<br/>
experience of the Latter-day Saints during the time the law has been taught to us, abundantly<br/>
demonstrates that all the Lord has said concerning it, and the promises which He has made,<br/>
are true, and can be confidently relied upon.  Proofs of this are to be foudn in every family and<br/>
Ward where this law has been observed.</p>

<p>When this was given as a standing law to the Latter-day Saints, to be observed by them<br/>
forever, we were instructed by the Lord that we were to pay one-tenth of all our interest annually,<br/>
and that we must observe this law or we should not be found worthy to abide among the Saints.<br/>
We were further told, ""If my people observe not this law to keep it holy, and by this law sanctify<br/>
the land of Zion unto them, that my statutes and my judgments may be kept thereon, that it may<br/>
be most holy, behold, verily I say unto you, it shall not be a land of Zion unto you.""</p>

<p>It is a law, which, if properly observed, will prepare the Church of Christ against the<br/>
day of vengeance and burning which will come upon the ungodly.  Too great importance, there-<br/>
fore, cannot be attached to its correct observance.   The Lord, through His prophet [[Malachi (OT)|Malachi]],<br/>
commanded ancient Israel to bring ""all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be<br/>
meat in mine house,and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the<br/>
windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.<br/>
And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground;<br/>
neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts.  And<br/>
all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts.""<br/>
These words are as true now and as applicable to us as they were then, and compliance with these<br/>
requirements will be attended with the same blessings; for God does not change, and those who<br/>
keep His commandments to-day, we are assured, will receive His blessings as freely as they have<br/>
done at any other period.</p>

By paying strict attention to this, the Wards will be kept in a healthy condition, the Spirit of the Lord will flow freely to the people, and the blessings of heaven will be upon them.  Among other duties, the Saints should be carefully taught the principle of paying their tithes strictly and punctually.  They should be impressed with its importance, for their own sakes and for the material advantages which will come to them by a close observance of this holy law. The experience of the Latter-day Saints during the time the law has been taught to us, abundantly demonstrates that all the Lord has said concerning it, and the promises which He has made, are true, and can be confidently relied upon.  Proofs of this are to be foudn in every family and Ward where this law has been observed.  When this was given as a standing law to the Latter-day Saints, to be observed by them forever, we were instructed by the Lord that we were to pay one-tenth of all our interest annually, and that we must observe this law or we should not be found worthy to abide among the Saints. We were further told, ""If my people observe not this law to keep it holy, and by this law sanctify the land of Zion unto them, that my statutes and my judgments may be kept thereon, that it may be most holy, behold, verily I say unto you, it shall not be a land of Zion unto you.""  It is a law, which, if properly observed, will prepare the Church of Christ against the day of vengeance and burning which will come upon the ungodly.  Too great importance, there- fore, cannot be attached to its correct observance.   The Lord, through His prophet Malachi, commanded ancient Israel to bring ""all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house,and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts.  And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of hosts."" These words are as true now and as applicable to us as they were then, and compliance with these requirements will be attended with the same blessings; for God does not change, and those who keep His commandments to-day, we are assured, will receive His blessings as freely as they have done at any other period.

<p>Dear Brethren:</p>

<p>The General Board of the<br/>
Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association have recently had under<br/>
consideration the advisability of publishing a magazine in the interest<br/>
of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations, to take the place of <br/>
the late magazine called the ""Contributor""; and necessarily when canvassing <br/>
the propriety of launching a new magazine on the community, the <br/>
literary affairs of the church had to be taken into account, which<br/>
finally resulted in the Board deciding to make the following communica-<br/>
tion to you upon the subject of Church periodicals, in the hope that some<br/>
steps can be taken, if those suggested for your consideration by the <br/>
board shall be adjudged impracticable, that will result in bringing <br/>
about a better condition of affairs as to church periodical literature.</p>

<p>First we would call attention to the fact that the Latter-day <br/>
Saints are called upon to sustain a rather large number of periodicals, <br/>
each of which is the representative of some special interest, or the <br/>
organ of some one of other of the many institutions that stand as helps <br/>
in government in the church of Christ, such as the late ""Contributor"",<br/>

Y. L. M. I. A.; the Juvenile Instructor, organ of the Sunday Schools, the <br/>
""Woman's Exponent"", organ of the Relief Societies, and the <br/>
Deseret News in its daily, semi-weekly and weekly editions as the organ <br/>
of the Church. The people are urged to sustain these several periodi-<br/>
cals on the ground not only of the intrinsic value of the publications<br/>
themselves, but also for the reason that it is their duty to do so be-<br/>

That the Sunday School Union has been in existence now about 20 years, has never yet asked any assistance from the Church, and that it numbers five times as many sould as the Improvement Association, (or about 60,000 officers and scholars.)"

has been self-sustaining, neither seeking finan=<br/>

of books, cards, music, etc. and also donted to aid<br/>
foreign missions, the brethren in the penitentiary, etc.</p>

From the quaker like silence that usually prevails after a prayer has been offered, for, and in their behalf, the whole congregation may have been fast asleep, during its presentation, as far as any outward manifestation proving to the contrary.

Strenuous efforts were made privately with the Judge,<br/>

<p>Dear Brother,</p>

<p>Your letter of April 10, notifying me of my appointment as a mem-<br/>
ber of the General Board of Education for the Church of Jesus Christ<br/>
of Latter day Saints, was received this morning and perused by me<br/>
with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>For many years has it been the chief aim of my educational ef-<br/>
forts to formulate a scholastic system founded upon and pene-<br/>
trated by the principles and spirit of the Latter day Work. These<br/>
efforts, although enjoying in some measure the approval of<br/>
the Authorities, have necessarily been confined to a limited<br/>
sphere and could not claim a general recognition from<br/>
the church. Your intentions, however, as expressed to me<br/>
previously, and the steps taken in this regard by the<br/>
Quorum of the Twelve, unanimously sustained by the<br/>
General Conference, demonstrate to me the fact, that<br/>
my hopes for the coming of this eventful epoch in our<br/>
church history have not been in vain, and I feel almost<br/>
to exclaim with [[Simon (NT)|Simon]] of old: ""O Lord, now lettest<br/>

hand and many thanks for your kind words.</p>

<p>Anticipating my probable withdrawal from the B. Y. Acad-<br/>

where I can work without interruption whenever I chose. <br/>
This will enable me under the present state of affairs, to spend<br/>
any convenient time before and after school hours in my <br/>
studyroom, and as I cannot be without work I may at-<br/>
tend to the edition of the German Book of Mormon as well<br/>
as to any other mental labor. As my own German B of M. <br/>
is too dear to me through many reminiscenses since 1853, as<br/>
that I could ^spoil it^ by the unavoidable process of paragraphing 55<br/>

in the Deseret News office for that purpose?</p>

consequence of the death of Sister Shepherd at [[Beaver, Beaver County, Utah Territory|Beaver]], her<br/>

immediately wrote to me. But I never received <br/>
his letter until his second letter of March 5<sup>th</sup>.<br/>
I thought it wisdom to forward to you letter, as <br/>
you will see his poverty, also the names he has sent<br/>
for approval. The men he has named are Spanish<br/>
Scholars, and I think would be able missionaries<br/>
among the Lamanites, if they meet your approval.</p>

to turn the attention of our missionary labor more<br/>
to the House of Joseph than we have done, as you<br/>
say ""the Gentiles are fast rejecting the Gospel"" and<br/>

<p>Beloved Bro. Wilford Woodruff:-</p>

<p>[[Brigham Young|I]] embrace the present opportunity of writing <br/>
a few lines to inform you that I received your epistle of the 8<sup><u>th</u></sup> <br/>
inst and its contents duly examined, therefore, I would say to you <br/>
in the first place that every thing is going on well here at the present <br/>
and the [[Nauvoo Temple, Nauvoo, Hancock County, Illinois|Temple]] is going on rapidly and with greater rapidity than <br/>
it has since the commencement, and the brethren are rejoicing in the <br/>
fulness of the Gospel of the Son of Man, and every thing seems to all <br/>
appearance to roll on and turn round for the well-being, happiness,<br/>
and prosperity of the Saints of Almighty God; praying that the <br/>
God who rules the Armies of Israel, and sits enthroned in the <br/>
heavens will hear our prayers in your behalf that you may be sus-<br/>
-tained and upheld by the faith and prayer of the Saints that you <br/>
may be unabled to fulfil your important mission which devolves <br/>
upon you with fidelity that the great work of our God may roll <br/>
forth in mighty power through your instrumentallity and the <br/>
kingdom of God be established never more to be thrown down <br/>
and when he whose right it is to reign should reign King of Nations as <br/>
he does King of Saints</p>

<p>There has been a great deal happened here since you left this <br/>
place and as you will see all the particulars by perusing the Neighbor <br/>
and times and Seasons where you will find that Elder [[Sidney Rigdon|Rigdon]] along with <br/>
some others have been tried &amp; cut off from the church by the unanimous <br/>
voice of the same, shortly after he came here he began to work secretly &amp; privately <br/>

<p>Dear Brother,<br/>
Your favor of Sept. 12. did come to hand at the proper time,<br/>
but it was not possible for me to answer any sooner, as I shall<br/>
endeavor to explain in this report.</p>

<p>In conformity with your telegram of yesterday week ago, <br/>
I instructed Bro. Savage to start at once to [[St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|St. George]], where he,<br/>
no doubtt, is engaged now in arranging matters for opening <br/>
of that Stake Academy.</p>

<p>Bro. Vaner had unfortunately made arrangements with <br/>
the Trustees at Oakcreek, unknown to me, that if he should <br/>
not be called to the [[Sandwich Islands|Sandwich Islands]], he would teach <br/>
their school this winter.  He is yet attending the Academy,<br/>
finishing his Normal Course, but intends going to Oak=<br/>
creek at Conference.  I told him that I did not approve<br/>
this step having been taken without my knowledge, but <br/>

Provo City, Utah, September 22, 1888 President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother, Your favor of Sept. 12. did come to hand at the proper time, but it was not possible for me to answer any sooner, as I shall endeavor to explain in this report.  In conformity with your telegram of yesterday week ago,  I instructed Bro. Savage to start at once to St. George, where he, no doubtt, is engaged now in arranging matters for opening  of that Stake Academy.  Bro. Vaner had unfortunately made arrangements with  the Trustees at Oakcreek, unknown to me, that if he should  not be called to the Sandwich Islands, he would teach  their school this winter.  He is yet attending the Academy, finishing his Normal Course, but intends going to Oak= creek at Conference.  I told him that I did not approve this step having been taken without my knowledge, but  that he must keep his word now with those Trustees.  In regard to the appointment of Bro. Alma Greenwood  for Joshua to succeed him at Fillmore, enclosed communications  will explain the situation of affairs at Fillmore.  I have  "

and then you will be able to give your instructions to the re=<br/>
spective parties in view of the prevailing facts.  I shall <br/>
write to President Hinckley and to the Bros. Greenwood that <br/>
the case has been referred to you for decision.</p>

<p>Bro [[Jacob Spori|Spori]] has written to me that he intends taking up <br/>
some district school to teach, and prefers, therefore, to attend <br/>
[[Brigham Young College, Logan, Cache County, Utah Territory|Logan College]] for the present.</p>

<p>I have now no one else anymore to propose, neither <br/>
for [[Rexburg, Bingham County, Idaho Territory|Rexburg]], nor [[Franklin, Oneida County, Idaho Territory|Francklin]], nor [[Coalville, Summit County, Utah Territory|Coalville]], and, as enclosed <br/>
letter from [[Paris, Oneida County, Idaho Territory|Paris]] explains, for that latter place neither.</p>

<p>The starting of an Academy in a new place, upon our <br/>
plan of Gospel education is so important a step, that any <br/>
failure of success will retard the work in that part of the <br/>
country for years.  Hence my reluctance in letting Bro.<br/>
[[Samuel A. Cornwall|Cornwall]] take hold of the work in Franchlin, as in some <br/>
points he is yet quite deficient; but as he has the spirit of <br/>
the Latterday Work in his heart, God may assist him greatly <br/>
in overcoming his deficiencies.  I shall answer the Bear<br/>
Lake authorities also that I had submitted their applic=<br/>
ation to you.  They had written to Bro. [[Benjamin Cluff Jr.|Benj. Cluff]], now <br/>
at [[Ann Arbor, Washtenaw County, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], to take charge of their Academy, but Bro.<br/>
Cluff had made up his mind long ago to stay at that <br/>
University at least until next spring, and longer if he <br/>
can raise the means.</p>

his option to go to [[Logan, Cache County, Utah Territory|Logan]], if that is the best he can do. But if<br/>

for next schoolyear we would furnish them a Principal <br/>
who would be able to organize an academic depart=<br/>
ment.  This was exactly the course which we had so <br/>
successfully pursued, only for a much longer period,<br/>
at the [[Salt Lake Stake Academy, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake Stake Academy]].  Bro. W. W. Cluff <br/>
told Bro. Nelson, he would send him the decision of his <br/>
Board by the end of this week.  If some of these Boards <br/>
will not meet us half ways just now, until we <br/>
have first class teachers at our disposal next summer,<br/>
our way will be much more difficult than it would <br/>

My letter of today to Bro. Hinckley will  give further particulars.  We had a lengthy conversation  with Bro. Greenwood last night, and got posted about the  status of the Millard Stake Academy.  I introduced during Conference Bro. Joseph Nelson to Pres. W. W. Cluff, after I had a conversation with him in regard  to the matter.  Proposing that Bro. Nelson was to start the Prepara= tory and Intermediate Grade during this schoolyear, and then  for next schoolyear we would furnish them a Principal  who would be able to organize an academic depart= ment.  This was exactly the course which we had so  successfully pursued, only for a much longer period, at the Salt Lake Stake Academy.  Bro. W. W. Cluff  told Bro. Nelson, he would send him the decision of his  Board by the end of this week.  If some of these Boards  will not meet us half ways just now, until we  have first class teachers at our disposal next summer, our way will be much more difficult than it would  be necessary.  Bro. Spori is spending this week with me again  in Provo, taking notes etc.  I have also furnished him  one of my Normals, Bro. Axle Nielson, a very  good young man, as Assistant, who will attend  particularly to the Language Part of teaching.  Bro.  Rix and his brotheren from Rexburg seemed to be "

in the favor of the chiefs of the Mohaves and that that was<br/>
the cause of his being appointed to go there. I have un-<br/>

Dear Brother Hinckley—I received your letter of Feby. 28, and have read it with care, and in reply would say that I do not expect you, in choosing a companion, to interfere with any president or bishop, or his counsellors, for there is generally plenty of persons in  the country who are willing to labor in such a cause without interfering with any of the organizations of the Church.  When I was in that country, we appointed quite a number of persons on the Lamanite mission. If you cannot get  any of them to go with you, look up some man who is willing to go without interfering with any of the organiza- tions of the Church. Brother L. Harris has written to  day that some one of the brethren has represented that he was in the favor of the chiefs of the Mohaves and that that was the cause of his being appointed to go there. I have un- derstood in your letters that it was his desire to settle there, and upon that ground we have appointed him, and Brother Mc Donald has informed me that he has appointed Brother Price W.

Brother [[Thomas Allman|Allman]] the plan for the tower and other<br/>
buildings of [[St. George Temple, St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory|St. George Temple]], and for him to pro-<br/>

read by the Presidency. Quite a <br/>
number were called at conference for <br/>

<p>Dear Brethren:</p>

<p>We understand that you have appointed Dr. J. E. Talmage to take charge or <br/>
oversight of the schools which are designed to be established in the various wards of <br/>
the Stake, for the purpose of giving the children who attend the district schools an <br/>
opportunity to learn theology. While we appreciate fully the importance of having <br/>
some thorough-going and suitable person to attend to this department, and think with <br/>
you that probably no better selection could be made than the one you have made, still, <br/>
in view of Dr. Talmage's other duties and his usefulness in other directions, we take <br/>
the liberty of suggesting that it is not a prudent thing to select him for this labor.  <br/>
Others can be found, no doubt, in your Stake who can attend to this, and who could not <br/>
do some of the work, at least, that Brother Talmage is doing. He is already burdened <br/>
with his labors, and it is not wise to overtax any of our brethren, especially those <br/>
who are engaged in brain work.</p>

<p>Trusting that you will be able to see the propriety of a change, and <br/>
that you will be able to find some suitable person to perform these duties,</p>

<p>To the Presidency of the Salt Lake Stake:</p>

<p>Dear Brethren:</p>

<p>The case of [[Joseph Shaw|Joseph Shaw]], <br/>
recently tried before the Bishop's Court in [[Sandy, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Sandy]], has been brought to our atten-<br/>
tion by a letter from Brother [[Joseph Edward Taylor|Jos. E. Taylor]], in which he states to us the action <br/>
of the High Council, to the effect that the High Council feel that they have <br/>
no discretionary power in such cases as his, and that they could only present <br/>
the facts and leave the matter with the First Presidency to determine, although<br/>
the spirit of humility and repentance which Brother Shaw manifested was so marked <br/>
that it made a deep impression upon the Council.</p>

<p>Since receiving this communication we have taken the whole subject of <br/>
such transgressions into consideration, and we wish now to say to you, and through <br/>
you to the High Council, that cases of this character you are at liberty to de-<br/>
cide upon according to the evidence that may be presented and ^as^ the Spirit of the <br/>
Lord is manifested to you in the consideration of each case.</p>

<p>We write this in order that you may feel free to exercise your functions <br/>
as a tribunal appointed by the Lord in this Stake of Zion.</p>

<p>With kind regards, Your Brethren,</p>

Br Brockbank pressed the case to a trial, the  result was that Br Fox acknowledged the debt, also his total inability to meet it, but was  willing to do so as soon as he was able  Our decision was that he should do as above  stated:  What else could we do?  Knowing  tolerably well the state of Br Fox'es affairs, that  his home was heavily mortgaged,  That the banks  held his farm, That he had collatted everything  he had in the world, And that he was trying to  save something from the general wreck for his"

<p>Dear Brother—Your letter of March 31 arrived in good<br/>
time, but it has been in President [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor's]] office a week, with<br/>
other documets for him to read, yet through the multiplicity of <br/>

read a long letter from [[Arza Erastus Hinckley|Arza Hinckley]], containing 25 pages,<br/>
all the testimony at the trial of [[Daniel Webster Jones|Dan. W. Jones]], all the testi-<br/>
mony against him, etc. When he found that there was a <br/>
power in the Church that could reach him, he came to and<br/>
made his confession, and he wrote a strong confession to <br/>
President Taylor. I hope he will remember this and keep <br/>
humble, and, if he does anything in the Church, that he<br/>
will do right and not defraud the Indians or white men,<br/>
either Saints or Gentiles. You will find inclosed in this<br/>
letter an order to cover the amount that you gave Brother [[Llewellyn Harris|Har-<br/>

as he told me, to [[Fort Mohave, Mohave County, Arizona Territory|Fort Mohave]], Mohave Co., Arizona. After <br/>
it was gone three weeks, it was sent back to me. There is<br/>

you to read it and then seal it up and send it to him<br/>

<p>In considering the regulations for the better maintenance of<br/>
good order in the [[Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]], we have decided to suggest to you that a <br/>

unnecessary walking backwards and forwards, and to maintain general<br/>
good order during the services in the Tabernacle.  They should be<br/>
instructed to treat the people with kindness and consideration, but by<br/>
their presence and the repressing of all unnecessary noise, either in<br/>
walking or conversation, it would be their duty to preserve that<br/>
quietude which should ever be maintained in th house of the Lord, and<br/>
when the worship of God is being attended to by his people.</p>

<p>Another point we wish to call to your attention, we have had<br/>
frequent complaints made to us concerning the ventilation of the<br/>
[[Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Tabernacle]], and now many persons suffer from the bad air they are <br/>
compelled to breathe while attending services there.  It is alleged that<br/>
because of this bad air it is difficult to resist the inclination to<br/>
sleep.  There can be no two opinions of the unhealthfulness of a badly<br/>
ventilated room, and no man or woman can worship the Lord with that<br/>
fervor and profit where they are inhaling poisonous atmosphere that they<br/>
would feel and receive if the air were pure.  We have decided to suggest<br/>
to you that Dr. [[James Talmage|Talmage]] be appointed to take charge of this business of<br/>
ventilating the Tabernacle, and when it shall be necessary to use the<br/>
heating apparatus, that he also have charge of that--not to do the<br/>
work himself, but to see that the building is properly ventilated, and,<br/>
in the winter time, heated.  His scientific knowledge will enable him<br/>
to do this probably as satisfactor<sup>ily</sup> as it is possible with such a<br/>
building.  It would be well, if you approve of our suggestion, that the<br/>
man whom you appoint to take charge of the corps of ushers should be<br/>
instructed to received suggestions or orders from Dr. Talmage concerning<br/>
these points, and, through him, the deacons or ushers be told what to do<br/>
about opening or closing windows or doors.  Such an arrangement, we think,<br/>
will be more simple than for the Doctor to tell the deacons himself.  We<br/>
think this matter of sufficient importance to impress it upon you and,<br/>
through you,  upon the Bishops of the several wards, so that our<br/>
worship may be free from every objectionable feature, such as bad<br/>
ventilation or disorder in the congregation.</p>

<p>We desire Bro. Thomas and all who have been performing these<br/>
duties heretofore to understand that it is our wish that these arrange-<br/>

<p>Dear Brother [[Arza Erastus Hinckley|A. E. Hinckley]].</p>

<p>I write to say that your letter of March 15 is before me. Concerning Bro-<br/>
ther Harris' going to [[Snowflake, Apache County, Arizona Territory|Snowflake]] and [[Forest Dale, Apache County, Arizona Territory|Forest Dale]]. He sent a letter to [[Jesse Nathaniel Smith|Jesse N. <br/>
Smith]], conveying an idea that he would like to go there, and Jesse N. Smith<br/>
sent me a letter, including Brother Harris' letter to him, both rather<br/>
wishing for him to be there awhile, but a man cannot be in but one<br/>
place at once, and as he has been appointed to go to the Mohaves and<br/>
already gone, that is all right, and I think that is the place where<br/>
he should be, for the present at least. With regard to that and all<br/>
other organizations of the Lamanite missions, they should all be <br/>
under the presidency of the stakes in which they are organized, and<br/>
the presidents of the stakes, under the direction of the Twelve Apostles, <br/>
and they under the direction of First Presidency of the Church, <br/>
and as President [[John Taylor, b. 1808|Taylor]] has put this mission into the hands of the<br/>
Twelve to direct, what we do we do by his counsel, and all these things<br/>
should be done according to the order of the Kingdom of God. If<br/>
I understand it, the Mohave mission will be under the superin-<br/>
tendency of [[Alexander Findlay MacDonald|A. F. McDonald]], or within the limits of his jurisdic-<br/>
tion. Therefore Brother Harris should consult with Brother Mc<br/>
Donald in the general direction of that mission and keep us advised <br/>
of all matters appertaining to its workings. If you can get the<br/>
man you spoke of to go with you, that is all right, as you want <br/>
some one to be with you who interpret your teachings, <br/>
so that they can be understoood by the Lamanites.</p>

<p>Sister [[Eliza Dana Gibbs|E. Gibbs]]—Your letter of June 17 is before me, as is Brother [[James Andrew Melville|Melville's]].<br/>
I have stated to him my situation, away from home a great deal of the<br/>
time attending conferences, and having a heavy correspondence and being<br/>
full of business, so that I cannot do justice in answering so many critical<br/>
questions as you ask in your letter, but I will answer the best I can. I shall<br/>
also have to answer for Mrs. [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Woodruff]], for she is not in a situation to write<br/>
letters as much at present, not being in very good health. You say that you<br/>
have a great desire to communicate with your [[Medora Victoria Gibbs Melville|daughter]] since her death,<br/>
and have prayed for it long and loud, and the request is not granted<br/>
you, and you feel sorely tried because it is not, and are almost ready<br/>
to turn infidel because the Lord does not grant your request. I wish to<br/>
say to you, Sister Gibbs, that you are asking something of the Lord that<br/>
it is not wisdom in him to bestow. As soon as the spirit leaves the<br/>
body and goes back to the Father who gave it, there are laws govern-<br/>
ing that spirit, so that it cannot return to its friends on earth, and<br/>
if it was granted to spirits it might cost them a great deal of sorrow.<br/>
I have known persons to make covenants together to return after death to visit a<br/>
husband, wife, or parents, but after death they never came back to fulfil their<br/>
pledges, for they found a law to forbid it. To answer all such questions,<br/>
I will say that the Lord never sends an angel to the earth to visit any body,<br/>
unless He has a message to be delivered or a work to be performed that can-<br/>
not be attended to otherwise; and the same with departed spirits, they<br/>
never return to communicate with the living on the earth, only by permission</p>","Salt Lake City, June 22, 1883.  Sister Melville's.

an angel to him, but the Lord did not do it, for He had no message to send to him, for he had<br/>

to answer all, but I will say when the spirit left the body it did not leave the room. She looked upon her body and upon<br/>
those in the room. The two persons who brought in her coffin were like other persons, did not see any other persons be-<br/>
sides, felt that it would have been a relief to have continued in the spirit world, but chose to return for her husband's<br/>
and [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|child's]] sake. The spirit has a spiritual tabernacle the same size of the body. Your [[Medora Ethel Melville|grandchild]] will be<br/>
with her mother, and she will have the care of it until the resurrection. She has obeyed the celestial<br/>
law and will inherit a celestial kingdom. No person who keeps a celestial law and dies and goes to the<br/>
spirit world, has any desire to come back to this wicked world, and you ought to be reconciled to her departure<br/>
to a better state. She is a great deal better off than those of us who remain. I got no particulars of her death,<br/>
only that she died in child-bed. Both male and female have a work to perform in the spirit world, the<br/>
same as in this life, according to the sphere they occupy. If there is anything left undone for your daughter,<br/>
it should be done in the temple. It is your duty and the duty of all the Saints to go into a temple, when they<br/>
have an opportunity, and do the work for their dead. No man knows when Christ will come. It is not<br/>
revealed, the day nor the hour. I do not know whether Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] will receive their<br/>

Pending the time when all who love liberty and the rights of their fellow men may unite on a platform of equal justice, we urge the importance of prompt action and constant effort to strengthen the rank and file of the People's  Party, always avoiding the unwise policy of urging for office or position those who have not the confidence and respect of the people, and possibly otherwise unqualified for the suffrages of the legal voters.  The apathy and careless indifference of the people at the last election for Delegate to Congress shows the great necessity of prompt action on the part of the law abiding citizens of the Territory."

<p>Dear Brother—Your letter of Feb. 27 arrived all safe, but I have not had<br/>
time to answer before, and now I have not much news to communicate, <br/>
only that God reigns and is our friend. Congress closed and [[George Franklin Edmunds|Edmunds]]<br/>
had not had power to pass his bill, even through the Senate, against us. [[George Quayle Cannon|Geo.<br/>
Q. Cannon]] and [[John Thomas Caine|John T. Caine]] are at home with us again, in good<br/>
health and feeling well. The devil, Edmunds, [[Philip Taylor Van Zile|Van Zile]], and that class<br/>
of men are no better pleased with us than before. Well, I do not expect <br/>
they ever will be. I think we are having the most pleasant March<br/>
we have ever seen in [[Utah Territory|Utah]], ploughing, sowing, and building have been<br/>
going on through most of the month. The Presidency and Twelve<br/>
are as well as usual. We have appointed a meeting of the Twelve for<br/>
April 2nd, Monday, when we expect eight of the Twelve present, to attend<br/>
to whatever business may be necessary to prepare for Conference. [[Charles Coulson Rich|C. C. Rich]]<br/>
has had another attack and is quite poorly. [[Brigham Young Jr.|Brigham Young]] and [[Heber Jeddy Grant|H. J. <br/>
Grant]] will not be with us at Conference. They are visiting the Laman-<br/>
ites of [[Arizona Territory|Arizona]]. They have visited all the seven villages, but have not re-<br/>
ported their labors to us yet. We shall keep [[George Teasdale|Geo. Teasdale]] with us<br/>
until after Conference, though he expected to get off on his mission be-<br/>
fore. Our stonecutters are cutting the last course of the Temple granite<br/>
to the square, which we hope to see laid on the wall the coming summer. <br/>

High Council has jurisdiction in his case, for the reason, as he  alleges,<br/>

the [[Salt Lake City Temple, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Temple]] in this City, as then announced by President Wilford Woodruff.</p>

<p>Our decision is that both the High Council and the Bishop's<br/>
Court have jurisdiction in a case where a charge is made of the character<br/>
that has been preferred against Brother Plant.  It is true that President<br/>
Woodruff did promise the people that their sins should be forgiven; but<br/>
this forgiveness was not designed to extend to transgressions of so<br/>
grave a character as it is charged that Brother Plant has been guilty<br/>
of, unless the sins have been confessed and the law of the Lord on that<br/>
subject complied with.  There is a law of the Church which requires<br/>
that sins of this character must be confessed, not necessarily to the<br/>
whole church, but the confession should be as widely made as the offence<br/>
was known, and forgiveness should be sought for from the individuals or<br/>
from that portion of the Church that is cognizant of the transgression.</p>","First Presidency relating to Charles M.

<p>My Beloved Children:</p>

<p>You have again the privilege of enjoying the <br/>
society of your [[Emma Smith Woodruff|mother]]. I am thankful for this. I want to give <br/>
you all a word of Council. Considering the signs of the times, <br/>
the persecution of our Nation against us, and my own age, you <br/>
cannot reasonably expect to enjoy much more of my society as your <br/>
father in this life; but you have with you your mother. Now if it <br/>
was the last testimony I was to give you on earth, I want to say <br/>
be kind to your mother. You cannot always expect to have her with <br/>
you, although she may live a score of years or more, the time will <br/>
be short. Do not give way to anger or say or do anything that <br/>
you will be sorry for, but I pray you to be united with your mother <br/>
and with each other, and act for each other’s interest. Again I <br/>
wish to say to you, my children, that I know God lives, that Jesus <br/>
Christ is the Son of God, and the Saviour of the world, and he <br/>
shed his blood to redeem us from death, and God raised up [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph <br/>
Smith]] as a true Prophet of God, who brought forth the Book of Morm<strike>n</strike>on<br/>
and laid the foundation of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-<br/>
Day-Saints]], the only true and living Church upon the face of the <br/>
whole earth, with which the Lord is <strike>m</strike> well pleased; and the Church <br/>
of Christ, and the Zion and Kingdom of God has been organized on <br/>
the earth for the last time, and this Church and Kingdom of God will <br/>
stand and fill the whole earth and be thrown down no more forever.</p>

<p>Now you all belong to this Church and Kingdom of <br/>
God on earth, and I want you all to persue a course so as to never <br/>
be separated from the Church in time or eternity. As your father <br/>
has been called to the Apostle-ship, which office I have held near <br/>
49 years, and have now been called to stand as the President of the <br/>
Twelve Apostles.  Now as an Apostle and as your father, I have a <br/>
right to coun<strike>s</strike>cil you and give you advise. There is one particular <br/>
thing I want to impress upon your minds; that is, study the revelat-<br/>
ions of God and have faith in them,—The Bible, Book of Mormon and <br/>
Doctrine and Covenants. And I want you all to begin in your youth to <br/>
make your wants known unto the Lord in prayer; ask him for what you <br/>
want,—not as a ceremony, but in faith, and he will hear you and <br/>
answer your prayer.</p>

<p>Now my children, harken to these sayings, and put <br/>
them in practice. These revelations of God are true and will be <br/>
fulfilled. I want you all to be saved and ^to^ be with me in the [[morning of the first resurrection|morning <br/>

the Saints. This is the prayer of your loving father.</p>

ion of the Council that the Clerk ought to be paid from the <br/>

<p>1st.  This is the largest and most important Sake of the <br/>
Church, the Clerk is exclusively engaged in performing <br/>
public service in the interest of the people, and so long as he <br/>
is thus engaged has no other source of support.</p>

the General Tithing Store, there is no other source than the <br/>
fund that can be drawn upon for the payment of a Clerk.<br/>

<p>I regret that it has become <br/>
necessary for me to write you of a matter that during a <br/>
year and seven month past has been a matter of serious <br/>
thought and much concern to me,  In the month of September <br/>

became sick of Asthma, her sickness increased until it was<br/>
thought she would have to return home, She was very resolute <br/>
and determined to remain and fullfil the mission ass-<br/>
-igned her, We took her to Honolulu ^in Feby^ thinking the change might <br/>
benefit her.  She improved and returned here and recovered <br/>
sufficiently to be able with difficulty to do her part of the kitchen <br/>
work and household duties up to December 1890. Since then she <br/>
appeared to be near dieing.  She has passed a part of many,<br/>
many, nights in her chair inhaling vapors to aid her<br/>
respiration, Her sickness has worn upon her until she is <br/>
now very thin, and week.  We have thought that the <br/>
summer months might bring her relief, We still hope <br/>
for this.  Our experience of the two last winters, witness to us <br/>
that it would ^be^ very unwise for her to attempt ^to pass^ an other <br/>
winter here, We think also that she would be taking great <br/>
risks in returning in the cold fall months, It would <br/>
seem that she should return while the weather in Utah,</p>","Laie Oahu April 26th/91 Prest W.

books of the Mission and the charge of [[Laie, Kingdom of Hawaii|Laie]] and will tomorow <br/>

Dear Brother,  In conformity with the resolution of the General Board,  that it should be my duty to visit the church schools as  much as occasion should require, and in compliance  with your special instructions, I made positive appoint- ments for the Stake Academies at Coalville, and  Morgan, intending to make the time of my further appoint- ments ahead depending upon the amount of work that  should require my attention at the aforesaid places.

I arrived at Heber city, Saturday Oct. 26. in the evening and was cordially welcomed by the Principal Enoch Jor- gensen, spending the evening with him in getting posted  in regard to the condition and prospects for the new es- tablished Stake Academy. Sunday attended service at  the Stake Tabernacle, at which Pres. Hatch requested me to  give the people a Gospel Sermon as I should have a chance  to talk on Education in the evening. I, therefore, gave them  a ""Gospel Sermon"" merely on another subject. I had, however,  the opportunity to converse during the whole afternoon private- ly with President Hatch at his residence, during which"

As this seminary is the only churchschool in  Rich County, and the feeling of the bretheren there  seems almost uniformly point to the hope that some  day they will be organized as a Stake for themselves,  and the status of their school, as well as the intelligent  management of the latter by the LocalBboard,  entitle  them to the kind of consideration of the General Board,  the proposition of elevating that Seminary to the grade  of an Academic suggested itself forcibly to my mind, and  I submit it, therefore, respectfully in this report."

M. on Saturday,  Nov. 16. and spent the afternoon with him and talking  over with him the affairs of the College. As it was not my  intention to visit the College this time, having made my  appointment for Brigham City for the following day,  I had to promise to spend two weeks with the College  after New Year, teach the Normal Class during that time in Theory of Teaching, and give those Normals the  keynote, as it were, for examination, as some of them  intend graduating next spring. In the evening a mee- ting of all the teachers of the College was held, at which  a very beneficial interchange of ideas concerning our  labors in the great work of education in Zion was en- joyed. Sunday morning I attended the Missionary  Meeting at the College and was made happy in wit- nessing the faithful testimonies borne by many of the  students. The meeting was crowded testifying thereby the  interest the students take in the Latter day Work."

servants of the Lord, and to attend to some very pressing business<br/>

<p>I returned on the 13th. inst. from visiting the Mississippi,<br/>

<p>Dear Brethren, [[Elias Smith Kimball|I]] only mention these details to show you the spirit<br/>
that is taking possession of our Elders. They are working with a zeal<br/>
that is indeed commendable, yet are not accomplishing nearly so much<br/>
as I believe they are capable of doing with the help of the Lord. I<br/>
am a firm believer in the truth, that there is no end to mans capacity<br/>
for doing good, if he will but seek after God and keep His commandments.</p>

<p>The Elders are keeping the Word of Wisdom now, I believe, all throug^h^<br/>

they stop with to do the same. Hundreds of people, not members of the<br/>
church, are obeying this teaching. A strong effort is being made to<br/>
convert the Saints to pay their tithes and offerings. Success is crowning<br/>
our efforts. At this time the outlook indicates that the Elders will<br/>
gather, this year, nearly $2000.00 in tithes and offerings.</p>

and prayer. They are meeting with fair success. The Elders are acting<br/>

<p>A very gratifying thing for you to know is that the Elders are<br/>
""Capturing"" villages, county seats and cities, and, while there, are stopping<br/>
at hotels and with the leading citizens, many of whom come to them and<br/>
beg of them to stay with them part of the time while they are sojourning<br/>

the <u>great</u> ones of this country—politicians, Judges, Lawyers, Doctors,<br/>

but not so commonly as of late. The frequency of these occurrences have<br/>
come to light since the Elders went out this summer from their conference<br/>
gatherings to prove the Lord by traveling ABSOLUTELY without purse or<br/>
scrip. [[Elias Smith Kimball|I]] define these last six words to mean, that the Elders are to<br/>
have no money to pay for washing nor even to buy stamps. They must go<br/>
out, ""for this commandment is unto all the faithful who are called of<br/>
God in the church unto the ministery,"" [##Doctrine and Covenants 84:86##] and trust implicitly to God to<br/>
raise up friends to them, ""who will give them food, who will give them<br/>
raiment and who will give them money."" [##Doctrine and Covenants 24:18##] And I bear testimony that the<br/>
Lord is fulfilling His promises to His Elders in every case where they<br/>
are keeping ""this commandment"" and are in need of anything. The Lord is<br/>
even, in cases where the Elders are scrupulously carrying out this<br/>
""commandment,"" providing them with money to buy their tracts and books<br/>
in publishing the gospel.</p>

referring to fasting and indulging in a spirit of rivalry among the<br/>
Elders in breaking records, [[Elias Smith Kimball|I]] beg you will pardon me for the seeming<br/>
delay that has occurred. I was away from the office when your letter<br/>
came, and since returning my health has been very poor, but is fast im-<br/>
proving.</p>

<p>I do not think I can say anything in answer to the question you <br/>
refer to that will so fully explain matters as to inclose several<br/>
circular letters I have written to the Elders of this mission at differ-<br/>
ent times. I would respectfully and especially call your attention to<br/>
circular letters, dated March 25th, 1896, and April 12th, 1897, marked with<br/>
blue pencil. You will please notice the brethren are left to do as they<br/>
may deem proper, no restraint being placed on them. I have never desired <br/>
to make any iron rules by which to govern my brethren. That I have made<br/>
many, very many mistakes, I am very frank to confess, and from what you<br/>
say has come to your ears, I do not know but that I have made a grave<br/>
mistake in saying so much about fasting as is contained in these<br/>
letters. Instead of leading the mission in fasting, the different con-<br/>

<p>glad to accept it. The only special fast [[Elias Smith Kimball|I]] have ever asked the Elders<br/>
to engage in is the one referred to in circular letter #15. Afterwards<br/>
I was sorry that I did this, for I worried that it might prove a hard-<br/>
ship on some of the new Elders. When we have had Elders laying very<br/>
sick and they have written, requesting the Elders to fast and pray for<br/>
them, I have written the conference Prest's. to notify their brethren to<br/>
fast and pray for the sick among us. In no instance however, that I can <br/>
remember, have I ever suggested how long they should fast. It is true<br/>
that some of the conferences, if not all of them, have held special<br/>
fasts, have I ever suggested how long they should fast. It is true<br/>
that some of the conferences, if not all of them, have held special<br/>
fasts, but not at my dictation. Fasting in this mission seems to have <br/>
had its growth without any particular direction from any source, unless<br/>
the Elders have been taught by the Holy Spirit, which I believe to be<br/>
the case. Quite often word comes to the office of Elders who have just<br/>
finished a fast preparatory to entering some city to canvass it. I have <br/>
never felt to reprove the brethren for thus fasting, but rather have felt <br/>
to rejoice that they have had faith in these things. I have tried to <br/>
look at these matters calm<strike>n</strike>ly and dispassionately and do nothing that <br/>
would be contrary to the mind and will of the Lord, and would not in the<br/>
least annoy you; and I do feel, my dear Brethren, that there is no cause<br/>
for alarm that any of the Elders will be injured from too much fasting.<br/>
It has been nearly two years since an Elder has died in this mission.<br/>

<p>Dear Brethren:</p>

<p>[[Elias Smith Kimball|I]] hand you herewith a copy of a set of resolutions sub-<br/>
mitted to me by the Elders of the West Va. Conference while attending<br/>
said conference on the 1st,2nd. and 3rd. of August, requesting that I use<br/>
every means in my power to have a paper published in the Southern States <br/>
Mission similiar to the Millennial Star.</p>

<p>Having already talked with you on this subject and having followed<br/>
out your suggestions about learning cost of such a publication I herewith<br/>
submit Messrs McGowan and Cooke's bid which furnishes said information:</p>

<p>""A paper the size and style of the Mellinnial Star wuld cost<br/>
about $500.00 for twenty six editions of 600 copies.""  There would be<br/>
twenty six editions per annum.  Each Elder in the Mission would have to<br/>
be patriotic and generous enough to subscribe for a copy and then work<br/>
among Saints and friends to take the balance of the edition. There are<br/>
now about 360 Elders in the mission.  I think every Elder in the mission<br/>
will take hold of the project with the same spirit which actuates the<br/>
Elders of the West Va. Conference.</p>

<p>If you are favorable to the project and will kindly recommend me to<br/>
start it, I shall agree to make it self sustaining from the start,beg-<br/>
inning its publication some time in the early winter.</p>

<p>A paper published in the interests of the mission would be a <br/>
great assistance to the Elders,and would help the work on wonderfully,<br/>
in that it would encourage the Elders to greater exertion.</p>

<p>The paper,if started,could be called the Southern Star or any other<br/>
name you might suggest.</p>

<p>Dear Brother: <br/>
Enclosed please find our <strike>quarterly</strike> ^<span class=""unclear"">[]</span>^ report.<br/>
I am visiting the conferences and find the Elders <br/>
feeling first rate. Occasionally release an Elder on <br/>
account of sickness. Have some sickness amongst them, <br/>
but trust all will work out right.</p>

<p>We wrote this morning regarding the sending out<br/>
to the Southern States one Elder at a time without us <br/>
receiving any notice of his coming. We send them to <br/>
their fields of labor and in some cases they will have<br/>

the Semi-Annual Report of this mission ending Aug 31, [18]90<br/>
I was mistaken, in making the statement found in my<br/>
last to you, that our number of baptisms were greater <br/>
this year than for a corresponding time last year. In-<br/>
stead they are scarcely one half. I had been misinformed. <br/>
I am engaged at present time in visiting the different<br/>
Conferences in the Mission. I have already visited three <br/>
of them and find their affairs in a fairly prosperous con-<br/>
dition New fields have been found so far where all the<br/>
Elders could return to and where there were a sufficient <br/>
number of investigators to keep them busily engaged. <br/>
Several have already been baptised this month and more<br/>
have applied which applications will be attended to as the<br/>
Brethren return to their fields of labor. In fact most<br/>
of our baptisms were performed during the past two<br/>
months.</p>

<p>Dear Brother: <br/>
Enclosed you will please find the Semi-Annual<br/>
report of this Mission <span class=""unclear"">[]</span> July 28<sup><u>th</u></sup> 1890. [[William Spry|I]] trust<br/>
it will prove acceptable to you. As you will notice <br/>
our number of baptisms have decreased more than one half<br/>
than those of a corresponding time last year. The Elders labor-<br/>
ing here however have labored as valiantly and earnestly as<br/>
ever before, losing no opportunity afforded them of reaching<br/>
the people, and the only cause I can attribute for the falling<br/>
away, is that the honest in heart are becoming more scarce and<br/>
that the numbers are not to be found today in Babylon who<br/>
will receive the Gospel as there were in former years.</p>

<p>The brethren generally are hardworking, energetic men<br/>
in the ministry, full of hope and willing to do all they<br/>
can, or go wherever they may be sent to further the Cause<br/>
of Truth. They are faithful and true to this calling, and<br/>
by their example cannot fail to excite the admiration of<br/>

Box 103,  Chattanooga, Tenn., 9th March 1890  President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City Utah  Dear Brother:  Enclosed you will please find the Semi-Annual report of this Mission  July 28th 1890. I trust it will prove acceptable to you. As you will notice  our number of baptisms have decreased more than one half than those of a corresponding time last year. The Elders labor- ing here however have labored as valiantly and earnestly as ever before, losing no opportunity afforded them of reaching the people, and the only cause I can attribute for the falling away, is that the honest in heart are becoming more scarce and that the numbers are not to be found today in Babylon who will receive the Gospel as there were in former years.  The brethren generally are hardworking, energetic men in the ministry, full of hope and willing to do all they can, or go wherever they may be sent to further the Cause of Truth. They are faithful and true to this calling, and by their example cannot fail to excite the admiration of their fellow men, even though that admiration may be kept a secret in the breasts of those in whom it may  be aroused."

practiced by a people, who in other<br/>
respects, are law abiding, moral and <br/>

prejudice, nor treat lightly or de-<br/>

the world recognizes as just, that is, <br/>
what they have practices and what <br/>
they have accomplished, and they <br/>
deserve higher consideration than<br/>
ever has been accorded to them. <br/>
Industry, frugality, temperance, <br/>
honesty, and in every respect but<br/>
one, obedience to the law, are with them<br/>
the common practices of life.</p>

<p>This land they have redeemed<br/>
from sterility, and occupied its once<br/>
barren solitudes, with cities, vill-<br/>
ages, cultivated fields and farm<br/>
houses, and made it the habitation<br/>
of a numerous people, where a beg-<br/>
gar is never seen and alms-houses<br/>
are neither needed or known. These <br/>
are facts and accomplishments <br/>
which any candid observer recog-<br/>
nizes and every fair mind admits.</p>

<p>SWEARING, drinking, gambling, <br/>
idleness and licentiousness have <br/>
made but small headway among the<br/>

people. There is less licentiousness <br/>
in Salt Lake City than in any other <br/>

Dear Brother,  In compliance with my instructions I herewith submit respectfully the Annual Report of the operation of our church- schools during the academic year 1890—1891.

the rest of the Saints in a four hours meeting under the in-<br/>

Rawlins, in confirming himself strictly to his Academy work exclusively, looked that sympathy with and from the people, without which the best efforts of a Prin= cipal in his classwork are wanting the life giving on sirement, and the finest products of intellectuality did in the cold climate.  The Board accepted a proposition of Bro. Rawlins to close the school at the end of the third term, as it might be deragatary o his reputation if the Academy should dwindle down under his hands."

If you simply desire, at the present time, to make an appropriation to cover the approaching Academic Year,  I think that $20.00000 will meet the ordinary expenses  for that period.

<p>Dear Brother - [[George Reynolds|I]] write with regard to matters relating to the General <br/>
Board of Education. First- With regard to the expulsion of unruly students<br/>
from the Church Schools, and their admission afterwards to other Church<br/>
institutions. I submit that this is a matter that most properly belongs to<br/>
the department of the General Superintendent, and, therefore, that Brother<br/>
[[Karl Gottfried Maeser|Maeser]] be requested to write a letter on the subject, which letter will<br/>
submit to you and, on receiving your approval, forward it to the principals<br/>
of each of the institutions of learning under the control of the General Board. <br/>
I am in entire accord with the views expressed by Brother Maeser, that no<br/>
student who has been expelled from one of our schools for misconduct should <br/>
be received into another Church school until he has made matters right with<br/>
the officers of the school from which he was expelled.</p>

<p>I see no impropriety in the questions that Gen. supt. Maeser desires to<br/>
put to the Principals of the various schools, for the information of the Board, <br/>
with regard to the Faculty, Departments, Studies, Condition, Prospects, etc, of <br/>
each school. To comply with his request will give the individual officers but<br/>
little labor, and place a vast fund of information at the command of the Board, </p>","Salt Lake City, Dec. 24, 1888.  President Wilford Woodruff,  City.

arises.</p>

<p>The questions presented by the Board of Weber Stake will probably <br/>
require a meeting of the General Board before they can be answered. These<br/>
questions are:</p>

<p>""1st. In the event of the property or money being donated for the support <br/>
of the [[Weber Stake Academy, Ogden, Weber County, Utah Territory|Stake Academy]] how will it be held- in whom will the title rest?</p>

Stake 'Ecclesiastical Corporation?'</p>

<p>""3rd. Is the Weber STake Board of Education intending to organize under<br/>
the Laws of the [[Utah Territory|Territory]] as an Incorporated Association?""</p>

<p>It seems to [[George Reynolds|me]], so far as the first question is concerned, that the<br/>
Stake Board of Trustees is the proper body in whom the title for such property <br/>
should rest.</p>

<p>In regard to the second question, it appears to me that it would be <br/>
desirable, at any rate at present, not to mix our school matters and ""Eccles-<br/>

answering, but there are a few Stakes that have organized since our last meeting<br/>

As you naturally would desire to know what, and how much means would, with what we still can raise ourselves, be necessary to con- tinue the work this season, we take the liberty of stating that we need two thousand dollars in produce of different kinds. We have expended upwards of $ 9000.00, and would have raised more had we not  explained to the people that our donations should not interfere with our tithing liabilities, and we believe that they took our advice as our last years tithing was increased by $2813.27 over the year before.  Hoping that our conclusion may be favorable to our much needed enterprise  We remain  Faithfully Yours  Wm Budge James H. Hart. Wm L Rich"
