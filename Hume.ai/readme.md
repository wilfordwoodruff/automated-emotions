#Running Hume.ai on the Wilford Woodruff Papers
Welcome! This folder lets you collect new entries, assign them to Hume.ai jobs, then get the results. It runs on the smallest unit of the papers: A single day's values on a single page. The last step of this process can take those values and re-aggregate them to be on a single day (combining journal entries and letters from the same day) or by UUID.
