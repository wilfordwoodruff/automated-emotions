with the crowded situation of the boat, caused a return of the <u>chills</u> and <u>fever</u>, which I had every day for<br/>
the last week of my journey. I took stage at Albany at 10 oclock at night, travell'd through the night, and<br/>
also the next day, and finally arrived at [[Avon, Hartford County, Connecticut|Avon]] about sunset. spent the night at Aunt [[Helen Woodruff Wheeler|Wheelers]], the next<br/>
morn being the 21<sup>st</sup> of Sept. I arrived at [[Aphek Woodruff, b. 1778|Fathers]] house at [[Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut|Farmington]], and had the happy privilege thro’<br/>
the blessing of God, of once more meeting Fathers household face to face, have now been at home about 10 days<br/>
and immediately on my return home as I began to be recruited from my journey, my health began to<br/>
amend, and did not have my turns of fever and ague, although I have felt the effects of it in some<br/>
degree from day to day, but I would here say that I have felt perfectly easy as regards the affliction of my<br/>
body feeling confident that I shall soon recover my usual health. and I would here say as <u>before</u> that I do<br/>
not wish you to give yourself an uneasiness as it regards my health, only give me your prayrs, and all will<br/>
be well. I would just also remark that I lacked nothing on my journey as it regards my temporal wants, and<br/>
had 50 cents left when I arrived at Fathers, and my purse is beginning to be replenished so that I shall<br/>
be enabled to continue my journey in a few days. since at home I have had an interview with most of the<br/>
Saints that belong to this small branch of the church. Uncle [[Ozem Woodruff, b. 1787|Ozem Woodruff]], Sister [[Anna Hart Cossett|Anna Cossitt]] brother [[Dwight Webster|Dwight—<br/>
Webster]] &amp;c. were among the number, and I felt truly ^to^ rejoice<s>s</s> before the Lord to find them firm in the faith<br/>

have a <u>Zion</u> <u>spirit</u> desiring to gather with the Saints. I would say that my <u>Grand</u> <u>mother</u>, [[Anna Hart Thompson, b. 1756|<u>Anna</u> <u>Thompson</u>]],<br/>
departed this life a day or two since. was buried yesterday. We have visited Uncle [[Adna Thompson Hart|Adna Hart]] found him quite low<br/>
and to all appearance near the borders of the grave. as it regards the rest of our friends they are usually well,<br/>
I have not as yet heard from any of our friends in [[Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine|Scarborough]], but I expect soon to see brother [[Ilus Fabyan Carter|Ilus]] in<br/>

<p>Dear [[Phebe Whittemore Carter Woodruff|Sister]]<br/>
As Willford has reserved for me a page to fill, I will now cheerfully (tho’ in something of a hurry)<br/>
seat myself to pen you a few lines. I recieved your Letter at the hands of my brother and was truly glad to<br/>
hear from you, was sorry however to hear of the ill state of your health as also that of your family, but<br/>
how it will soon be improved. Wilford as you are aware is quite unwell, and we feel as <u>you write</u>, much<br/>
anxiety respecting him, as he is about to undertake such a journey. and it seems to me as tho’ I could<br/>
not have him leave us so soon, but then, we know that God has <u>called</u> and said “<u>Go</u>”, and<br/>
shall we worms of the dust say <u>stay</u>' Nay, but let us rather rejoice that he is accounted <u>worthy</u><br/>
to become a messenger from God to the nations of the earth. but still my natural feelings at times<br/>
gain the ascendency and I can hardly reconcile myself to have him leave us. I need not say that<br/>
W. is a brother that I set much by of <u>this</u> you probably are aware. but as [[Asahel Hart Woodruff, b. 1814|Asahel]] is <u>gone</u>, my<br/>
affections return with double force upon Willford. I place confidence in <u>him</u> as I formerly did<br/>
in Asahel, looking to him, as a friend and protector, I hope however I shall not forget that<br/>
my comforts and blessings flow from God, the bountiful giver of all good,</p>

<p>I suppose I shall have to be brief at this time, but I shall write you from time to ti[me] [page torn]<br/>
shall hope to hear from you often, and do give us a particular account of things an[d] [page torn]<br/>
with you, for we shall ever be glad to hear, and also as it respects the situation of the church.<br/>
I would ask no greater blessing than to be permitted to take up my residence with the Saints with the<br/>
Saints at the west, I would be willing to undergo ma[n]y earthly privations. I have felt as tho’ I should<br/>
like it much could I be with you whilst W. is gone his mission, but I suppose it would not be<br/>
considered consistent at present. but I do feel as tho’ I should be permitted e'er long, to stand on<br/>
Mount Zion with the blessed company. pray for me Sister, that I may live in such a manner<br/>
as to be accounted worthy to escape the just judgments of God abroad in the land, and finally<br/>
have a standing given me with the saints of God. I have been quite unwell most of the time since<br/>
W. has been at home and consequently have not received as much pleasure in hearing him converse upon<br/>
this Latter day work, as I otherwise should have done. but we have had a very pleasant with him, and<br/>
shall remember it with much pleasure. the greatest complaint I make is that I have not had scarcely<br/>
any apportunity of conversing with him myself. I hope the Lord will <u>grant</u> that he may have grace<br/>
given him to perform his mission acceptably. that the Lord would be with him and bless him<br/>
continually. grant <u>him</u> with the rest of the company a safe and pleasant journey over the waters<br/>
and when their mission is fill'd return them safe to the bosom of their friends.</p>

<p>My Dear Willford</p>

<p>I think that you will believe me when <br/>
I say that it is with peculiar feelings that I commence this sheet to you <br/>
my dear Willford what will be your feelings when I say that yesterday <br/>
I was called to witness the departure of our little [[Sarah Emma Woodruff|Sarah Emma]] from this <br/>
<s>wold</s> world- yes she is gone — the relentless hand of death has snatched her from <br/>
my embrace — but Ah! she was to lovely to kind to affectionate to live in <br/>
this wicked world — when looking on her I have often thought how<br/>
I should feel<s>l</s> to part with her I thought I <s>thought</s> could not live <br/>
without her especially in the absence of my companion - but she is gone<br/>
the Lord has taken her to himself for some wise purpose — It is a severe <br/>
trial for me to pass through particularly so in you absence but the <br/>
Lord has stood by me in a wonderfully manner I can see and feel<s>l</s> that <br/>
he has taken her home and will take better care of her than I possibly <br/>
could for a little while untill I shall go and meet<s>t</s> her — Yes Willford<br/>
we have one little angel in heaven and I think it likely her spirit <br/>
has visited you before this time — I do not know how to live without her<br/>
she <s>I</s> used to call her poor pa-pa and pretty pa-pa many times in a day <br/>
she left a kiss for her pa-pa <s>just</s> with me just before she died — she <br/>
eat her dinner as well as usuall thursday about 4 oclock she was<br/>
taken with a prestness for breath we done every thing for her that we <br/>
could called for the elders and had her anointed a number of times and <br/>
hands laid on her but all to no avail the next day her spirit took its flight<br/>
from this to another world without a groan so that now I am dep-<br/>
rived of every thing near and dear to me but my little darling [[Wilford Woodruff Jr.|Willford]] <br/>
for the things of the world are empty and vain to me and he is not verry <br/>
well — Today Willford and I with quite a number of our friend ac-<br/>
compaing<s>s</s> us came over to Commerce to pay our last respects to our<br/>
little darling in seeing her decently buried — she had no relatives to follow</p>",Commerce July 18th 1840  My Dear Willford  I think that you will believe me when  I say that it is with peculiar feelings that I commence this sheet to you  my dear Willford what will be your feelings when I say that yesterday  I was called to witness the departure of our little Sarah Emma from this  wold world- yes she is gone — the relentless hand of death has snatched her from  my embrace — but Ah! she was to lovely to kind to affectionate to live in  this wicked world — when looking on her I have often thought how I should feell to part with her I thought I thought could not live  without her especially in the absence of my companion - but she is gone the Lord has taken her to himself for some wise purpose — It is a severe  trial for me to pass through particularly so in you absence but the  Lord has stood by me in a wonderfully manner I can see and feell that  he has taken her home and will take better care of her than I possibly  could for a little while untill I shall go and meett her — Yes Willford we have one little angel in heaven and I think it likely her spirit  has visited you before this time — I do not know how to live without her she I used to call her poor pa-pa and pretty pa-pa many times in a day  she left a kiss for her pa-pa just with me just before she died — she  eat her dinner as well as usuall thursday about 4 oclock she was taken with a prestness for breath we done every thing for her that we  could called for the elders and had her anointed a number of times and  hands laid on her but all to no avail the next day her spirit took its flight from this to another world without a groan so that now I am dep- rived of every thing near and dear to me but my little darling Willford  for the things of the world are empty and vain to me and he is not verry  well — Today Willford and I with quite a number of our friend ac- compaings us came over to Commerce to pay our last respects to our little darling in seeing her decently buried — she had no relatives to follow,5a9312dc-ed34-4680-a812-d638ae065ca3,0.0564270503818988,0.0782474130392074,0.0099531961604952,0.001810560002923,0.0085014980286359,0.0083944657817482,0.0399192459881305,0.0379508659243583,0.0062033552676439,0.0008602972957305,0.0160184875130653,0.0020978681277483,0.0088414652273058,0.0548556596040725,0.0120667051523923,0.0112953763455152,0.0030948743224143,0.0030243950895965,0.0537904947996139,0.0091779455542564,0.0075746276415884,0.2279085963964462,0.0027740562800318,0.0025594567414373,0.0083171064034104,0.610801100730896,0.0044287918135523,0.0121998991817235,0.0011406345292925,0.0018784260610118,0.014142413623631,0.0796153843402862,0.042557455599308,0.0144319450482726,0.0100782848894596,0.0098955044522881,0.208942025899887,0.1325181126594543,0.3425688147544861,0.013925259001553,0.0467752665281295,0.0166798010468482,0.0113111548125743,0.8615908026695251,0.0030426918528974,0.0084550762549042,0.0011873162584379,0.0407767072319984,0.025335818529129,0.0029424331150949,0.4315519630908966,0.014012711122632,0.0030456783715635
